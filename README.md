## 🚦 Optimizing Urban Transportation Using Social Media Sentiment Analysis
### 📌 Project Overview
"Optimizing Urban Transportation Using Social Media Sentiment Analysis" is a data-driven project that leverages Reddit posts to analyze public sentiment about urban transportation systems. The goal is to identify common traffic-related issues such as congestion, accidents, delays, and infrastructure problems to provide actionable insights for transportation planners and urban developers.

By collecting data from various Reddit communities (subreddits), this project analyzes posts and comments to categorize sentiments into Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It also identifies frequently discussed transportation modes, infrastructure challenges, and service quality issues.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
Analyze public sentiment on urban transportation issues using social media data.
Identify key areas of improvement for traffic management and public transport systems.
Provide actionable insights to optimize transportation infrastructure and services.
### 🗂️ Data Source
The project collects data from the following Reddit subreddits:

r/urbanplanning – Discussions about urban development and traffic planning.
r/transportation – General transportation topics.
r/publictransit – Public transportation services (buses, trains, subways).
r/roadcam – Real-time road incidents and dashcam videos.
r/cars – Driver experiences and road safety concerns.
r/infrastructureporn – Discussions on infrastructure projects and designs.
### 🧰 Technologies Used
Python – For data collection, cleaning, and analysis.
PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) – To connect to Reddit API and retrieve posts and comments.
Pandas – For data manipulation and cleaning.
TextBlob – For performing sentiment analysis.
Plotly – For creating interactive visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook – To run and document the project workflow.

### 📊 Project Workflow
The project follows these main steps:

Data Collection – Connect to Reddit API and scrape posts from selected subreddits.
Data Cleaning – Preprocess the text data by removing links, special characters, and redundant content.
Sentiment Analysis – Classify posts into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments using TextBlob.
Data Visualization – Generate interactive visualizations like pie charts, bar charts, and line charts using Plotly.
Report Generation – Summarize insights into a comprehensive report.
