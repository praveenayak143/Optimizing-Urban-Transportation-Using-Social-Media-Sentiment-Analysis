urbanplanning,traffic,The number one reason people move to suburbs (it's not housing or traffic),"The main reason the vast majority of families move to suburbs is schools. It's not because of the bigger houses with the big lawn and yard. It's not because it's easy to drive and park. It's because the suburbs are home to good schools, while schools in most major cities are failing. I'm surprised that this is something that urbanists don't talk about a lot. The only YouTube video from an urbanist I've seen discussing it was City Beautiful. So many people say they families move to suburbs because they believe they need a yard for their kids to play in, but this just isn't the case. 

Unfortunately, schools are the last thing to get improved in cities. Even nice neighborhoods or neighborhoods that gentrified will have a failing neighborhood school. If you want to raise your kid in the city, your options are send your kid to a failing public school, cough up the money for private school, or try to get into a charter, magnet, or selective enrollment school. Meanwhile, the suburbs get amazing schools the you get to send your kids to for free. You can't really blame parents for moving to the suburbs when this is the case. 

In short, you want to fix our cities? Fix our schools. ",458,331,2024-03-18 01:46:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1bh7e4h/the_number_one_reason_people_move_to_suburbs_its/

urbanplanning,traffic,Why doesn't NYC have pedestrian walkways that are uninterrupted by auto traffic?  ,"Recently, I picked up walking trying to complete my fitness ring everyday. I live in NYC but visit my parents in the suburbs regularly. I noticed completing my fitness ring in my suburban neighborhood is much quicker and more pleasant experience than in NYC. I am assuming it is quicker because of the lack of traffic signals everywhere. It makes me wonder why NYC hasn't invested in overpass walkways or something where pedestrians could walk without having to stop every other block for auto traffic and perhaps the walkways can also be prettier than the cement sidewalks. Kind of like how the Highline Park in NYC is. I've visited other cities, like Bangkok and Mumbai that have similar overpass walkways, feels like a solid idea.

I mean ofc there is a cost aspect, but is there any other practical reason?

urbanplanning,traffic,How do you think we can balance pedestrian safety with traffic flow in suburban areas that are starting to see more foot traffic? Are there solutions beyond just adding more crosswalks or traffic lights?,"As suburban areas evolve and start seeing more pedestrians, the traditional solutions of adding crosswalks or traffic lights don‚Äôt always seem to work. We‚Äôve all seen those neighborhoods where adding lights every few blocks just leads to frustration for drivers and sometimes even gets ignored by pedestrians.

So, how do we create safe, accessible spaces that respect both pedestrians and drivers? Are there alternatives that can improve safety without overloading an area with signals?

For example, some places use raised crosswalks, which slow cars down but don‚Äôt require a full stop unless there‚Äôs someone crossing. Others are experimenting with things like pedestrian islands or zigzag road markings, which naturally slow down traffic and give pedestrians a safer crossing spot.

Or, look at concepts like ‚Äòshared space‚Äô zones, where pedestrians and cars coexist with minimal signage or signals, relying more on design to guide behavior. Of course, these ideas don‚Äôt always work everywhere, but maybe there are hybrid approaches that could work for suburban settings.

urbanplanning,traffic,Traffic Calmed Shoulders,"Hi all,

I'm very happy that the parks department in my area is doing a 4->2 road diet. The final plan has two 10' lanes and a 3' shoulders. I'm worried that they will effectively be 13' lanes (especially when the paint wears away after a year) which could negate much of the traffic calming effect. It seems me that curb to curb distance is big psychological driver of speed. The parks department wants people to drive 25 mph or less.

At the public meeting the engineer cited emergency vehicle access the reason for the shoulders (i.e. cars pull over and amblance drives down the center). Indeed it is a main route for nearby hospital. The department won't consider raised crossings/speed bumps. 

The plans are at 90% but there is still time for public comment. Do you guys know of any relevant studies/examples? Should the shoulders be textured, striped more agressively, changed to center median etc ? Am I worrying over nothing?

urbanplanning,traffic,"Do you think too much focus is placed on walking, cycling, and public transit as a way of addressing traffic, environmental concerns and the need for affordable mobility?","I'd argue it does. Lots of cities in south east Asia that are far from walkable (let alone bikeable) and are too poor for public transit have turned to mopeds and motor cycles as a way of addressing traffic, environmental concerns and the need for affordable mobility.

But a lot of urbanists in the west seem to turn up their nose at this. The fact is, a lot of North American neighborhoods and in cases entire communities were not built with walkability, bikeability or transit in mind. If we're committed to addressing traffic, environmental concerns and the need for affordable mobility, then maybe we should turn to what has worked in south east Asia.

Mopeds don't take up more space than a cargo bike, even gas powered scooters are far more environmentally friendly than cars, and a brand new moped costs as much as a used car, with much lower insurance and fuel costs. They don't require redesigning every street or spending half a billion per kilometre to extend a subway line. At most, they may require redesigning or building bridges or crossings to be safe for mopeds and ensuring there exists convenient parallel routes to major highways.",0,30,2024-09-27 02:11:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1fq6ejh/do_you_think_too_much_focus_is_placed_on_walking/

Once they're done, however, it's back to ""normal"" ie, being a deathtrap. 

It's not like some jersey barriers, cones, and signs could be that expensive to implement on a large scale. It's also immediate vs spending huge sums of money for permanent improvements on just a few streets while the rest are left subpar and dangerous. You'll also notice that although traffic is moving more slowly, it's way easier and safer to be a pedestrian or cyclist in these temporary environments. Which begs the question, why aren't traffic studies done during these lane closures or traffic signal outages? In Minneapolis we have three lane one ways with two additional parking lanes and no bike infrastructure on such streets. When they're down to a single lane or the signals are out motorists are still getting to where they need to be without endangering others.

urbanplanning,traffic,Colocating traffic with higher-density?,"My city of residence has this clause in their ""Neighborhood Traffic Management Program"":

    The General Plan ensures that arterials and collectors provide access to the higher intensity commercial and residential districts. It is intended that local streets in single-family districts be protected from the adverse impacts associated with traffic generated by either higher intensity development or changing travel patterns. 

I ask because I imagine that ""higher intensity residential districts"" also deserve to be protected from the adverse impacts of traffic--in fact they suffer more from localized pollution and traffic violence. I say this because I expect that residents of higher-density areas are less likely to be car-dependent & are more likely to be vulnerable road users.

While I see the merit in protecting single-family neighborhoods from heightened traffic, it seems to me like the policy indirectly limits the potential for mixed-use or higher-density developments, as the single-family areas remain ""protected"" at the expense of others.

urbanplanning,accident,Why America should not build Light Rail,"Note: This post was copy-pasted from my [blog](https://saumikn.com/blog/thoughts-on-light-rail/), but I‚Äôve put the full text (minus images) here so it‚Äôs easier to engage with and meets the r/urbanplanning posting rules.

# Introduction

Light rail (or LRT) is a type of transit which uses street-running, at-grade trains to transport passengers. It‚Äôs been seeing a growing surge of interest in American cities over the last few decades, and politicians across the country are proposing light rail as a solution to their cities‚Äô transit challenges. The reason is that light rail is seen as a technology which can improve a city‚Äôs transportation network at a fraction of the cost of heavy rail (i.e. subways or elevated rail).

However, I strongly feel that we should not be pursuing the construction of new light rail (and the related mode of streetcars) systems in America. The simple reason for this is cost - new light rail lines cost anywhere between $100 million to $200 million per mile to construct. As an example, the proposed 5.6 mile¬†[St. Louis Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(St._Louis_MetroLink))¬†is projected to cost $1.1 billion.

This high price tag isn‚Äôt inherently a bad thing. There have been many expensive projects over history which were well worth the cost. The problem with light rail specifically is that we get almost no value back from its construction. For transit riders, there are almost no benefits to a light rail line over a simple bus line, and in a lot of respects, light rail is even worse for riders. And for cities as a whole, light rail does lead to some improvements and increased development, but at a scale which is very out of line with its high cost.

Instead of light rail or streetcars, I propose that transit agencies invest heavily in a different mode of transit - ‚ÄúLight BRT‚Äù. If you haven‚Äôt heard of this term before, it‚Äôs because I invented it for the purposes of this article, as there is no single widespread term which characterizes this mode. I‚Äôm personally hoping that the phrase Light BRT catches on, as it‚Äôs a very convenient nomenclature to describe these existing transit lines and in a way which is easily distinguishable from the more traditional¬†*Gold-Standard*¬†or¬†*Heavy*¬†BRT.

So what is Light BRT? Essentially, Light BRT is a type of city bus which includes many infrastructure upgrades to increase the speed and reliability of the bus line. While not every light BRT line has all of these features, in general, light BRT lines are characterized by the following:

* **Wider stop spacing:** Light BRT buses have stops every 1/4 to 1/2 miles, rather than the 1/8 to 1/4 mile stop spacing of regular city buses. This reduces the amount of time the bus spends at stops.
* **High frequency:** Light BRT lines come frequently, ideally at least every 10 minutes. This reduces passenger waiting time.
* **Signal priority:** Light BRT buses have technology which integrates with city traffic lights. This reduces the amount of time the bus is waiting at a red light.
* **Off-board fare collection:** Instead of the bus operator collecting fares for each passenger, passengers pay at the station itself, and fares are validated using a proof-of-payment system. This reduces the amount of time the bus spends at stops.
* **Bus lanes:** Light BRT may operate either entirely or partially in dedicated transit lanes. This increases bus travel speeds while in motion.
* **Larger buses:** Light BRT takes advantage of larger buses with many doors, such as articulated or bi-articulated buses. This increases the capacity of the system and reduces the amount of time the bus spends at stops.

Each of these improvements leads to a much nicer transit experience for passengers, directly leading to faster trips and higher ridership. For example, in Minneapolis, the D Line launched in late 2022, where they implemented most of the above features on the existing #5 local bus. The D Line was a huge success, well beyond anyone‚Äôs expectations. In the first¬†*month*¬†alone, ridership on the D Line¬†[increased 50%](https://www.metrotransit.org/corridor-ridership-up-after-d-line-opening)¬†when compared with the previous city bus. And by the end of the first year, ridership had¬†[nearly doubled](https://metrocouncil.org/News-Events/Transportation/Newsletters/Annual-transit-ridership-2023.aspx)! As of early 2024, the D Line has a ridership of over 13,000 daily riders, a number which is actually higher than many light rail systems, and this number is projected to hit 23,000 riders by 2030.

And the best part? This line was incredibly cheap. The 18 mile D Line cost about $75 million in total to construct, for an average cost of about $4 million per mile. Compared to light rail, which can cost $200 million per mile, light BRT is a steal. Or in other words, for the same cost it would take to build a 5 mile LRT line, we could build over 200 miles of light BRT, leading to a much better transit network for an entire city.

As a side note, I want to contrast Light BRT with the more traditional form of BRT (which I‚Äôll denote as ‚ÄúHeavy BRT‚Äù) which features very prominently in the transit systems of many international cities like Istanbul, Jakarta, and Bogota. Heavy BRT is also growing in popularity in the US in cities like Albuquerque, Richmond, and Cleveland. It is characterized by a dedicated concrete guideway which separates the bus from car traffic, and often features center running operations. There is a wide range of intensity of BRT operations (hence the need for the¬†[BRT Standard rubric](https://itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/)). But in general, heavy BRT can cost anywhere between $8 million to $50 million per mile to construct, with the lower end of this spectrum mostly resembling light BRT.

In the rest of this post, I hope to make a convincing argument on why we should stop building new light rail and streetcar lines, and instead transition to prioritizing light BRT. First, I will give a brief overview on the various forms of transit so that we have a common set of definitions to work off of. Next, I will provide an objective set of differences between light rail and light BRT, going over the benefits and drawbacks of each mode for both transit riders and non-riders. Finally, I will give my personal opinions on each of these differences, and why I believe that we should not pursue light rail in America.

In many of the examples and discussions, I will specifically reference the example of the proposed St. Louis Green Line LRT, since it‚Äôs one I‚Äôm more familiar with and I think it‚Äôs an example of an egregiously bad light rail line. But my comments are generally applicable to any new light rail or streetcar line in the US.

# Overview of Transit Modes

In this section, I‚Äôll give a brief overview of the various types of transit modes which are built with rail and buses.

# Types of Rail

* **Heavy Rail:**¬†This is the highest capacity and most expensive transit mode, consisting of long train sets operating in an entirely grade-separated right-of-way. Examples include the New York Subway or the Chicago L.
* **Light Rail:**¬†This is a lower capacity mode and less expensive than heavy rail. LRT systems are mostly not grade-separated, but run alongside street corridors, usually operating in a dedicated lane outside mixed traffic. Examples of light rail are the Minneapolis Light Rail or the San Diego Trolley.
* **Heavy+Light Rail:**¬†As a side note, there are many LRT systems which are very close to heavy rail but are still considered light rail. In these systems, where the vast majority of the system is grade-separated and operates like heavy rail, but there are still a few at-grade crossings. Examples of this are the Seattle Link or the St. Louis MetroLink.
* **Streetcars:**¬†In America, the distinction between LRT and streetcars is very fuzzy, but in general, streetcars usually refer to at-grade trains which run in mixed traffic, and are essentially treated like a city bus on rails instead of tires. Examples of streetcars include the Portland Streetcar or the Kansas City Streetcar.

# Types of Buses

* **""Heavy"" BRT:**¬†Heavy BRT aims to replicate heavy or light rail with buses as much as possible, with dedicated concrete guideways separated from mixed traffic and rail-like stations. Examples of heavy BRT include the Albuquerque ART or the Cleveland HealthLine.
* **""Light"" BRT:**¬†Light BRT can be thought of as an upgraded city bus, with features like transit signal priority, optimized stop spacing, and off-board fare collection. Examples of light BRT include the Minneapolis aBRT, the New York SBS, or the Seattle RapidRide.
* **City Buses:**¬†This is the standard mode bus which operates in every major city, operating in mixed traffic without any extra features to improve transit operations. It‚Äôs possible for buses to use special propulsion technology like electric engines with batteries, or elevated wires (i.e. trolleybuses).

# Light Rail vs Light BRT

Next, I will go over the differences between light rail and light BRT. Because there are a lot of differences, I‚Äôm going to organize my thoughts into two sections. First, I will discuss the difference between modes in terms of the experiences that actual riders on the system will encounter. Second, I will discuss the difference between modes for everybody else - how it affects non-riders, government officials, citizens, etc. In both of these sections, I‚Äôll describe what makes LRT better than light BRT, and vice versa, and I will do my best to make these sections as objective as possible.

Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge that many of these thoughts come from my reading on transit modes and systems around the country. In particular, Jarrett Walker‚Äôs post on¬†[Rail-Bus Differences](https://humantransit.org/2011/02/sorting-out-rail-bus-differences.html)¬†was a very useful starting point for this post. Also, I'd like to acknowledge the discussions I‚Äôve had with other transit enthusiasts for pointing out things I've missed (shout-out¬†[St. Louis Urbanists](https://stlurbanists.org/)!)

# Differences for Transit Riders

# How Light Rail is better than Light BRT

* **Overall Capacity:**¬†This is the biggest, most-cited reason why light rail is better than light BRT. Most common LRT vehicles have a carrying capacity of 200 to 300 passengers per car and can be connected in sets of two or three cars. Assuming a maximum of 2 minute frequency, this gives us a potential capacity of 27k passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD). On the other hand, the largest bi-articulated buses can carry 300 passengers at most. With no ability to combine buses together, this means a maximum capacity of 9k PPHPD.
* **Bike/Wheelchair Capacity:**¬†On a related note, LRT can carry not only more passengers, but more large mobility aids like bikes, wheelchairs, or strollers. A single bus can only really hold 3 bikes on the front racks, while the interiors of LRT can be arranged to accommodate more bikes. The extra space on LRT also allows for more space for wheelchairs, strollers, scooters, and other types of mobility devices, or even just large items in general like suitcases or furniture.
* **Ride Smoothness:**¬†Because LRT is on metal rails, it is more smooth while accelerating, decelerating, and driving. This can be mitigated for buses by ensuring the street is well-paved and using¬†[bulb stations](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/curb-extensions/bus-bulbs)¬†so that buses don't have to switch lanes every other block, but some intrinsic difference remains.

# How Light Rail is equal to Light BRT

* **Speed:**¬†Overall, the speed of buses and trains on city streets are approximately the same. I've seen some claims that buses are slightly faster at accelerating/decelerating, but most of the speed differences are due to the infrastructure supporting the transit, not the vehicles themselves. If both modes have dedicated lanes, signal priority, equal stop spacing, and off-board fare collection, they will both be roughly the same speed.
* **System Legibility:**¬†For new riders who have never taken transit, learning how to take the train is generally easier to learn how to take the bus. However, with enough effort, transit operators can make buses just as legible.¬†[Well-designed maps](https://humantransit.org/basics/the-case-for-frequency-mapping)¬†can highlight BRT routes, and bright, continuous, red-painted lanes make it equally easy to understand the direction of a bus and a physical rail line.

# How Light Rail is worse than Light BRT

* **Operating Costs:**¬†The data shows that LRT generally has higher operating costs than buses. According to analysis by¬†[Christopher MacKechnie](https://www.liveabout.com/bus-and-light-rail-costs-2798852)¬†in 2020, in America, buses have an hourly operating cost of $122, while LRT has an hourly operating cost of costs $233 per hour. What this means for riders is that transit operators can afford to run more buses than trains under a fixed operating budget. As an example, if an agency is planning to run an LRT with 15 minute frequency, they could afford to run a bus with 8 minute frequency for the same cost, providing a much more useful service.
* **Dealing with Obstacles:**¬†Because LRT is on rails, there is essentially no way for it to maneuver around obstacles or go in places where there is no rail. This is most obviously a problem if there is an accident or the rails are blocked by e.g. a parked car. But even more importantly, this is a long-term issue that can prevent full service. For example, the¬†[2022 St. Louis floods](https://www.metrostlouis.org/nextstop/metrolink-flood-damage-update/)¬†damaged the light rail signal box at one station, causing all trains to be plagued with single-tracking and slow speeds for nearly two years! If this were a BRT, the bus could just pick an alternate road to go around without harming operations.
* **Fewer Transfers:**¬†Because LRT is limited to rails, it makes it much more difficult to extend a route once it‚Äôs created. This forces passengers from outside to the immediate vicinity of the rails to transfer from a bus. For example, in St. Louis, we currently have the #4 and #11 buses which go from the edge of the city to downtown. But when the Green Line is built, these passengers will mostly likely be forced to get off the bus and transfer to the new LRT, and then transfer¬†*again*¬†to get to downtown. On the other hand, in an¬†[open BRT system](https://humantransit.org/2021/04/basics-should-bus-rapid-transit-be-open-or-closed.html), buses can easily be extended to continue past the end of the line, reducing transfers for customers.
* **Ease of Expansion:**¬†On a related note, the high costs of construction can make it difficult to ever expand an LRT system in the future. In St. Louis, there have been plans floating to extend the Green Line north, to cover the rest of the #4 bus route. But just this week, a¬†[new report](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/new-st-louis-metrolink-line-connecting-to-north-county-may-not-happen/article_10b6ae5a-21f5-11ef-af1c-9b89ba943195.html)¬†suggested that this extension might not be politically feasible. And there is essentially no discussion at all about a potential southern expansion to cover the rest of the #11‚Äôs route. On the other hand, light BRT coverage is much easier to expand, since the base road network already exists.

# Differences for non-Transit Riders

# How Light Rail is better than Light BRT

* **Energy Efficiency:**¬†Trains are more energy efficient than buses, because of the gains of efficiency by using rails. This difference is reduced to some degree if you consider the energy usage of a three-car light rail vs a single bus, but overall, trains are more efficient on a per-passenger basis. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt actually find hard numbers on how much energy exactly is being saved.
* **Maintenance:**¬†Trains require less maintenance than buses, and an electric train car will last longer than an electric bus. Additionally, trains cause less damage to roads, so you don‚Äôt have to maintain the steel rails as often as you do with the concrete pavement.
* **Development:**¬†An investment of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars into LRT signifies a huge commitment that a government has towards improving that corridor. As a result, new train lines tend to lead to more private development surrounding the stations than new bus lines. However, the magnitude of this effect is quite unclear. For instance, a¬†[report](https://www.stlouisfed.org/-/media/project/frbstl/stlouisfed/files/pdfs/community%20development/research%20reports/light_rail.pdf)¬†from the St. Louis Fed concluded, ‚ÄúThe general consensus from the academic literature and the findings presented in this report is that light rail is not a catalyst for economic development, but rather light rail can help guide economic development.‚Äù
* **Rail Bias:**¬†Possibly as a result of the above intrinsic differences mentioned, because of differences in actual implementation, or some unknown psychological difference,¬†[people tend to prefer trains over an equally useful bus](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2012/06/21/explaining-the-psychological-appeal-of-rail-over-buses). This leads to both higher ridership, and more prestige for a region (e.g. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not a real city until we have a few train lines‚Äù)

# How Light Rail is worse than Light BRT

* **Construction Cost:**¬†This is the biggest reason that Light BRT is better than Light Rail. In America, Light Rail tends to cost $100M-200M per mile to construct (e.g. the proposed St. Louis Green Line will cost $196M per mile for the 5.6 mile route). On the other hand, Light BRT costs maybe $5M per mile (e.g. the recently built Minneapolis D Line cost $75M for an 18 mile route).

# Conclusion

Finally, I will conclude this article with some of my opinions on the facts described above, going over each of the major differences between Light Rail and Light BRT.

# Why LRT is not better than Light BRT

The biggest factor in favor of LRT, capacity, is not a relevant distinction for essentially any new project, as light BRT has enough capacity to operate most LRT routes. For example, the proposed Green Line LRT in St. Louis has a projected daily ridership of 5k. A hypothetical light BRT could carry nearly 9k passengers every¬†*hour*, well above the needed capacity. I actually couldn‚Äôt find a single example of a light rail system in the entire United States which needs the capacity of light rail and couldn‚Äôt get by with buses. If somebody has a counterexample in the comments, I‚Äôd love to see it.

One thing to note is that the ongoing driver shortage might change this math. For example, one could imagine a corridor where an LRT with 15-minute frequency has enough capacity but a bus with 15-minute frequency doesn‚Äôt. My two comments about this is that (1) If the driver shortage is such a big deal that it‚Äôs limiting frequency, that should definitely be the priority for where to spend money, and (2) If you‚Äôre only running 15-minute headways, then this is not exactly a corridor that needs significant transit investment in the first place.

Another note is that buses generally have enough capacity for day to day operations, but occasional large events like sports games or concerts might overrun this capacity. I would suggest in these cases to run¬†[special express buses](https://www.mct.org/muny-express/)¬†on these days to transport passengers, rather than overbuilding rail capacity for most of the year.

I ride my bike and take it onto transit often, so I understand the appeal of bringing your bike on board to a light rail. But in reality, if our goal is to help urban cyclists, we would be much better off actually building protected bike lanes for a fraction of the cost of light rail. Alternatively, if St. Louis had an effective bus network, I wouldn‚Äôt even need to take my bike onto trains; I could just use the bus system to make connections!

Every other factor for transit riders actually favors light BRT over light rail. The smoothness of trains is nice, and makes it easier to read or work or relax while on it. But if I had to decide between a smooth LRT with 15-minute frequency and a less smooth light BRT with 8-minute frequency, I would definitely prefer the light BRT. And then when you consider that LRT usually leads to additional transfers for riders (usually to buses anyways), this only makes light BRT more attractive.

In terms of non-transit factors, I agree that rail leads to more development than buses. But if development is really our goal, we have much more effective and targeted methods for actually inducing development. For example, we could subsidize private development through upzoning and tax abatements or even take the money to build public development directly.

The factor of permanence is easily overcome - you could simply take the $200 million per mile which would have been used to construct the LRT and put it in a trust which can legally only be spent on transit operations in this corridor. The consideration of maintenance and efficiency also goes away based on LRT cost, as the interest alone from saved construction costs could be used to pay for maintenance and green energy technology many times over.

# What should we do instead of Light Rail?

I‚Äôve spent this entire post talking about reasons we shouldn‚Äôt build light rail. So what should we do instead? The short answer: it depends entirely on your priorities and why you even want to build light rail in the first place. If you‚Äôre going to spend $1.1 billion on a light rail line (as St. Louis has proposed to do), here are some things you could do with it instead:

**Transit**: If your priority is to help transit riders, you would be much better off by building Light BRT instead, for 1/40th of the cost. (i.e. for every mile of LRT you build, you could afford to build 40 miles of Light BRT). The above image is an quick example of what a potential 100 mile Light BRT system could look like in St. Louis. It would cost $400 million to build, instead of the $1 billion, 5 mile Green Line. You could then take the remaining $600 million to place in a trust fund for guaranteeing high frequency service along all these routes for years to come.

If you consider federal matching as part of your calculation, it‚Äôs roughly the case that the FTA will cover 80% of the cost of new light rail projects, and 50% of the cost of bus projects. For St. Louis specifically, both the 5.6 mile Green Line and my proposed 100 mile light BRT network would both cost $200 million in local funding, with the federal government picking up the rest of the costs. I would definitely argue that the 100 mile BRT network provides a much higher value for $200 million than the 5 mile train line.

**Long-Term Savings:**¬†If your goal is to reduce long term costs on street maintenance with LRT, you could instead take the $1 billion and put it in a fund to gain interest. The $40M you would get every year would be enough to¬†*quintuple*¬†current city street maintenance (we currently spend about $9M every year across the entire city).

**Environmental Impact:**¬†I don‚Äôt have any numbers to back this up, but I imagine that the difference in emissions between an electric LRV and electric bus is not that high to begin with. On the other hand, you could just take the $1 billion and give a free 3kW solar system to every single household in the city, which would save many orders of magnitude more emissions.

**Development:**¬†If your priority is to spur development, you should just take the $1 billion and use it to directly incentivize new construction. This could be done with tax abatements, paid-for without hurting school budgets. A¬†*very*¬†back-of-the-napkin estimate is that if $10 million is enough to cover¬†[this abatement](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/city-laws/board-bills/boardbill.cfm?bbDetail=true&BBId=14188), then $1.1 billion would be enough to pay for almost $16 billion in new development projects, 32,000 new housing units and 165,000 sqft of commercial space. For some context, in the last 10 years (2014-2023), St. Louis gained only gained 7,034 new housing units total. I haven‚Äôt seen any direct numbers as to how much development is expected from the Green Line, but I would expect this amount is far less than $16 billion, considering the state of the literature on LRT development referenced above. As a specific example, the Wellston station in St. Louis has been open for more than 20 years and still borders a huge undeveloped plot of grass.

**Bus Network Externalities:**¬†Some may object to my previous two recommendations of using the money to build solar panels and create tax abatements, rather than building transit, since funding sources are often not transferable like this, and rail funding might only be usable for transit projects. In these cases, I would still suggest building a large 100 mile light BRT transit network instead of a 5 mile light rail line. While I don‚Äôt have numbers to support this, I would strongly expect that this 100 mile network would lead to more emission reductions and more economic development than the 5 mile LRT line.

# Takeaway

In my opinion, when you consider all of the differences, there is really no reason why we should be building Light Rail or Streetcars anywhere in America. For transit riders, light BRT provides an arguably more useful service than LRT, at a fraction of the cost. For non transit-riders, LRT does have some positive effects, but in an incredibly cost-inefficient manner.

I‚Äôm sure this post has some very controversial opinions. If you disagree with me, and think I‚Äôm missing some broader point about LRT, feel free to let me know in the comments. I‚Äôm especially interested in actual case studies where the capacity of LRT was necessary over light BRT, or where LRT demonstrably led to increased development.",0,192,2024-06-07 21:24:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1dae6up/why_america_should_not_build_light_rail/

Compared to Vietnam there were 60,000 deaths over the 11 year period with about 2.7 million people deployed in uniform. 60,000 over 2.7 million is a much higher chance of fatality than 32,675 over 357 billion. If anything it's pretty amazing there are so FEW car related fatalities!

And yet buses and subway trains are constantly late. Buses are held up in traffic. Trams and trains have mechanical problems.

There's a higher degree of social disorder here compared to Asian/European cities with similar population and density, so crime sometimes delays the train.

I understand advocating for public transport and it's an excellent way to take advantage of existing infrastructure. And it's efficient for moving many people over a long distance.

But I can't get past how something like a car accident or police incident can disrupt 20k riders to be 15 minutes late. Many of those riders then miss subsequent train or bus connections.

urbanplanning,accident,"Transportation planners, how do I request stop signs at a dangerous intersection?","Hi there! I apologize if this isn't the correct sub for this question, I've never done something like this before and am trying to figure out how to go about it.

If this is the place, I was hoping to speak with any transportation planners about how I might request a 2-way stop in our village be turned into a 4-way stop, or at least request to have a safety evaluation done on the intersection. We have an intersection out here in a more rural part of the town that gets a good bit of traffic (for our area), always a car or two or three passing at a time. The problem is that the intersecting road (with no stop signs) comes from a pretty tight curve on one side and steeply downhill on the other side, so you only have a split second to see cars coming from either way. The speed limit here is 55 mph, and I'd say most people are going 60-65 through this intersection. There are lot of eighteen-wheelers and log trucks going through here as well. We had a motorcyclist die here about three years ago and I saw a fender-bender there two years ago. I'm not sure exactly how many other accidents have occurred in recent years, but I've definitely heard gossip of more. At least once a month I see someone squealing out of the turn to try and get on the road before someone appears, or an oncoming vehicle veering off into the gravel to try and avoid a crossing car who didn't see them. My family and many of our neighbors have complained about how nervous they feel turning or crossing at this intersection. We all go silent at it with everybody on the lookout for approaching cars and trucks, trying not to get T-boned every time we go into town.

I'm definitely not one to get involved in things like this and I know it might go nowhere, but my younger siblings are about to start driving this year and I'm worried for them‚Äî they're both scared of that intersection. I want to at least try to get some stop signs installed.

Should I contact my county's transportation planner? The state department of transportation? The mayor? Can I go to our sheriff's department to request crash data for that intersection to use as evidence for whomever I speak to? Will one person making a request matter, or do I need to rally the neighbors? Is this situation even concerning enough from a planning perspective to warrant addressing, or would there need to be a more significant amount of accidents there to get attention on this?

Where should I start? Thank you guys so much.",17,37,2024-03-20 02:59:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1bivwnu/transportation_planners_how_do_i_request_stop/
urbanplanning,accident,Bike signals and delays,"An argument made by vehicular cyclists, namely John Forester, is that dedicated bike signals for bike paths cause more delays compared to vehicular cycling. The idea is that when you have bicycle signals, you have additional signal phases to the signal cycle (e.g. motorist right turn occurs during a signal phase where cyclist is prohibited). This either means the total time it takes to cycle through all signals remains the same, leaving cyclists and even drivers with less green time, or the signal cycle is lengthened, leading to a longer wait for cyclists for green. Either way it‚Äôs delay.

Why do traffic planners do stuff like this? Why does Weber Rd need a double crossover for its highway interchange? A normal series of traffic lights and lefts would allow northbound and southbound drivers to cross over oncoming traffic and enter I-55. That would be completely standard configuration that would surprise nobody.

But this‚Ä¶it instantly confuses any driver not familiar with the area, possibly creating more accidents. It also seems like more pavement (cost). I notice non-standard and confusing traffic patterns like this ALL THE TIME in American suburbs and *especially* Florida.

urbanplanning,accident,Road Diet Case Studies?,"First time long time ‚Äì

My town received a grant for a road diet on our main drag. The town manager has slowly been warming up to the idea of bike lanes and traffic-calming measures like raised pedestrian crossings and traffic circles.

However, we need case studies to get this over the hump. Any suggestions on studies of town centers & main streets that have implemented these policies and how local safety and economic activity faired afterwards?

Deets:

‚Äì New England, USA  
‚Äì 30K total population  
‚Äì Suburb of 120K population city  
‚Äì Amtrak station with regional rail service 1 block from main street (!)  
‚Äì Interstate highway running parallel to the main street 1 mile away  
‚Äì 27K jobs in town with 16K working-age citizens, so pretty healthy influx of workers during the day, though mainly in less dense light industrial and office parks away from main street

To give a sense of the current space; it's a traditional New England town green ringed by town hall, town library, post office, a couple banks, and a lot of empty retail space. There is a development project in the works to bring apartments and three new storefronts onto the green at one end, 100 1br units at work-force housing pricing.

The main street is a state road and is currently 4 lanes wide with unusually wide lanes in one direction, as one of them doubles as on-street parking, though this is unmarked. There are lights at either end of the green with another light in the middle for a street that crosses the green.

One of the lights is for an intersection of the main street and the terminus of another state road at an angle to the main street. This intersection is quite large and has been the site of some very serious accidents as cars approach the intersection at pretty high speeds (45+) and have to turn mid-intersection to follow the state road. As you might imagine, crossing this intersection as a pedestrian is unpleasant, to say the least.

www.mehatch.com

One major concern I have is about potential changes to arterial streets with [traffic calming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) measures and dedicated bus lanes. Obviously, in residential neighborhoods, these methods can increase safety and create a greater sense of community, but on arterial streets such as Lincoln Blvd Link: 

https://www.smgov.net/Departments/PCD/Plans/Streetscapes/Lincoln-Neighborhood-Corridor-Plan-(LiNC)/

I'm concerned they're a bad idea, and will reduce LOS despite [reports generated by the planners.](https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/PCD/Plans/Streetscapes/Envision-Lincoln/Lincoln_Median_Traffic_Analysis_v4_11-10-15_FINAL.pdf)

In section 6.2 of that document, they claim simulations show traffic calming won't effect LOS, but I'm skeptical. The numbers regarding wait time in the following grid seem almost copy pasted. In an already super-congested artery, I just can't see how reducing lanes and overall traffic flow space will help with the commute, which seems like common sense...but common sense is lame if not backed up by data, which Is kind of why I've come to the /r/urbanplanning community.

Any advice you can give a curious aspiring public servant on this topic? I don't want to get set-in-stone on something if my initial leanings against traffic calming on arterials here might be off-base. 

For a larger context, there's been [significant local controversy](http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/02/22/venice-boulevard-road-diet/) here recently about road diets in other arterials in the West Side of LA, which were more clear-cut cases of reducing arterials by entire lanes, but this more subtle traffic calming planned in Santa Monica I still think might not be a great idea, especially given the ability of traffic apps like Waze to direct traffic through residential areas during arterial congestion, thus raising rates of pollution and potential for accidents in those residential areas. 

One last important item in the interest of transparency is that I'm likely working in partnership with www.keeplamoving.com but I'd like to know if you find any flaws in their [analysis](https://www.keeplamoving.com/) of these recent road diets on other local arterials. 

And for what it's worth, I'm a moderator of www.reddit.com/r/changemyview and I come here genuinely in the spirit of that subreddit, with the door open to data that could change my POV. I'm also a bicycling enthusiast who's also been personally impacted by pedestrian death, so I'm not coming at this without empathy for the POV of those wanting to implement road diets, but in the big view, I'm still very skeptical that they're a good idea when applied to arterials.

Thanks for any advice. 

Cheers.

urbanplanning,accident,How to fix this road?,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster.

There‚Äôs a highway that cuts through the town where I work that is an urban design nightmare (https://maps.app.goo.gl/681N1McmMPsc1fM38?g_st=ic ). It used to be your typical stroad with two or three lanes going each direction with a turn lane in the middle, but due to the sheer number of accidents they completely changed the design a few years ago where almost the entire road has a thick median and you can only make left turn or turn around at specific spots. I understand why they redesigned the road, there were accidents all the time, but the current design is also TERRIBLE.

My specific gripes
It takes a really long time to take a left, first you have to take a right, making sure all the lanes are clear because you have to cross all three lanes at once, only to get to the turn around and do the exact same thing again because you need all three lanes to make your turn around. This also backs up traffic frequently and leads to a lot of people being cut off. It‚Äôs also a nightmare when a semi is on said road because they block all three lanes of traffic in order to take a right into the turn around, and there‚Äôs not really a way for them to avoid it, this also frequently causes accidents. 
There is no way to avoid this road when driving through town for the most part, it‚Äôs the main road. 

There‚Äôs a light every 0.1 miles for like 3ish miles in the main commercial corridor, it can take you 10 minutes to just go straight because of all the lights, and the lights are green for a very short time but red for up to 4 or 5 minutes because of everyone being forced to use them to turn left or turn around. This leads to rampant running of reds, which causes an accident pretty often.

It‚Äôs bad for your car, taking a sharp U turn up to 10 times in a normal day is bad for your car, and so is the speeding up quickly on a right just to get to the turning lane to immediately brake hard.

It confuses GPS‚Äôs. GPS almost never gives me accurate directions and gets confused when I take the required U-turns. Because of this it frequently gives bad time estimates.

It makes people drive further, which leads to more emissions, obviously not the worst problem, but I feel like it‚Äôs worth mentioning.

There isn‚Äôt a sidewalk on either side of the road frequently, but there is a ‚Äúbreak down lane‚Äù or ‚Äúturn lane‚Äù on both sides, so people walk in this, but due to the turn around nature of the road, I‚Äôll frequently make turn arounds and almost hit someone walking becuase I never saw them, this also causes accidents becuase then people break, and someone driving hits them.

My proposed solution is a BUNCH of auxiliary roads running behind the businesses, like Main Street versus School Street in Boerne, Texas, but on a much larger scale. (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GFcYtTXcNe77H94V6?g_st=ic). 

The second part of this is stopping this kind of development on this road. Have larger developments with more contiguous parking lots, or something similar.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, and if anyone has a truly great one I‚Äôll bother the cities planning department with it, because I drive this road every day and it‚Äôs design drives me NUTS.

urbanplanning,roadblock,What are the largest roadblocks and pitfalls for municipalities using eminent domain to revitalize their downtowns?,"Hello all, thanks for reading. I live in a Rust Belt city who recently completed a road diet & walkable transformation of the main strip of our historic downtown, however, all of the mixed-use buildings on said strip are empty and boarded up (they are owned by negligent out-of-state owners and have been empty literally my entire life) and in need of repair/restoration. The few businesses that have managed to eek out an existence downtown are frustrated and some of the best restaurants have left for greener pastures; and this trajectory will continue no matter how nice the road and sidewalks are if there's no reason to walk around down there.

I've been researching eminent domain, and the federal and (my) state laws always specify ""necessity"" and ""public use"" - how does increasing affordable housing stock and business space fit into these terms? After all, the usability benefits the public and the increased tax base draw helps the community as a whole. Ideally, these historic buildings would be restored, not torn down, and rent-controlled to prevent gentrification. On this sub I've seen stories of eminent domain as a threat to the property owners - 'use these buildings or have them seized' - that ends up with the buildings being demolished, which is the exact opposite of the intention here. 

I'm still young but thinking of running for City Council in the next few years, and having a well-thought out plan of action for implementing new urbanist policies in my town is a make-or-break for me.

There has been a disappointing amount of backpedaling regarding ambition for the scope of transit after the [RTA's 2016 proposal failed](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/11/09/rta-regional-transit-authority-millage/93535602/) at the ballot. It seems like the takeaway that transit planners of this region got from the defeat was that the plan was ***too ambitious*** and should be scaled back instead of tabling a more robust proposal ([if you look at the RTAs 2023 ""update""](https://rtamichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RTA-2023RMTPUpdate-FINAL.pdf), you'll see that they're not even asking for more money than they were back in 2016 despite cutting ***all*** of the regional routes they suggested outside of the main 4 corridors).

Since the 2016 loss and the onset in this scarcity, austerity urbanist mindset, the argument that ***""Metro Detroit is too sprawled out to have rail transit""*** has been popping up more frequently as certain urbanists/transit enthusiasts grow disillusioned with political leaders in this region/state due to their complacency.

It's very grating to me that this argument keeps on being presented when it's easily defeated with 6 minutes of googling:


City | City Density (sq. mi)| Metro Density (sq. mi)
---|---|----
Detroit | 4,606 | 2,939
Calgary | 5,439 | 753
Denver | 4,674 | 4,167
Atlanta | 3,685 | 1,997
Twin Cities | 5,994 (St. Paul) 7,962 (Minneapolis) | 2,594

All of the metro areas (except Detroit) that I included have some form of rail transit and don't vary too much from our urban density. This point needs to be drilled into the heads of every single political leader in the state by local urbanists and we need to call them out whenever they attempt to propose the opposite.

##2) Taxes:

This is more of an issue for the entire Rust Belt region rather than Detroit and most of it's inner ring suburbs, for example, ***[the vast majority of the 15 cities with the most expensive property taxes in the country have been struggling with population loss](https://constructioncoverage.com/research/cities-with-the-highest-property-taxes-2023)***. The Other cities included are Texan cities who don't levy certain taxes that the Rust Belt cities do. The conversations surrounding the Detroit Mayor's LVT proposal has focused on suggesting that ***""the city's property taxes are the biggest obstacle to Detroit's recovery""***. But, even in a report that suggested ending tax incentives (including waiving property taxes) wouldn't likely end until 2053, [the Citizen's Research Council of Michigan said this](https://crcmich.org/PUBLICAT/2020s/2024/memo1177-Detroit_Economic_Condition_Economic_Development_Efforts.pdf) about the policy of property tax breaks (found on page 15):

> Effects on income distinct from increases in employment were not observed in reviewed research. Positive effects on employment and property values were
observed, two components to economic activity used
in this report. **Despite these positive observations,
each study noted the same difficulties in measurement
in that it is nearly impossible to discern whether a
business would have located or expanded within a jurisdiction with or without tax subsidies. How commonly
and freely tax subsidies are awarded in Detroit and
across the country undermine this type of analysis.**

There hasn't been any study or article that I've seen to suggest that it's practice of offering tax incentives has allowed revenue to grow in other areas to offset the lost revenue. Detroit needs to pinch every penny that it possibly can, [since Detroit's future pension obligations](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2023/12/08/detroit-police-fire-pension-lawsuit-20-year-payment-plan/71841904007/) are being fought in court, we have a scenario where, if we choose to minimize our obligations to our pensioners then we might effect the willingness of workers to find employment within city government, or, if we decide to give former employees their pensions in the timeframe that we promised them, we'd have to implement austerity. Both outcomes would drastically alter the city's future budget one way or another.",56,39,2024-02-25 18:58:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1aznx5q/in_metro_detroit_the_current_narrative/

I ask because I worry that removing restrictions wouldn‚Äôt actually change much if the budget is too tight to fund new stuff (there's other things which could delay change too, but let's put that aside for now).

urbanplanning,roadblock,SB9 Lot Split with a very specific set of circumstances,"A family friend has offered to sell us a portion of their 1.5 acre property to build a new house upon. The property has an existing home on the land. We are interested in moving forward but have hit lots of roadblocks while researching subdivisions in the traditional (non-SB9) way. Someone suggested looking into SB9 but I have several questions. From what I've read, SB9 is hardly ever utilized, possibly for good reason.

  
**Pertinent details:**

Sacramento County, California

* The lot split would be difficult to do in a 60/40 ratio. Not impossible, it would just require that the property line is very bizarrely shaped. The minimum lot size for our zoning (RD-2) is 20,000 sq feet and 40% of this lot would be 25,700 sq ft. Is there any legislation on the horizon to adjust the 60/40 ratio to allow for slightly more imbalanced splits? Closer to 70/30 would be so much better.

*  **IMPORTANT:** Does splitting the property under SB9 force a reassessment of the existing property and thus an increase in property taxes? The property currently enjoys very low Prop 13 property taxes and is significantly under-assessed. A reassessment would be a non-starter for this project to continue.

* Another route we have considered is building on the lot (an under 1200 sq ft house) as an ADU and then subdividing later. Or maybe not needing to subdivide if AB 1033¬†is green-lit in our area. The advantage to this would be a more immediate build timeline and the disadvantage would be risking subdividing difficulty later down the line, as well as necessitating an all cash build.

Does anyone have any insight into possible paths forward?",1,5,2024-07-26 11:34:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1ecgu0x/sb9_lot_split_with_a_very_specific_set_of/
urbanplanning,roadblock,A Different Approach to Zoning Reform,"This idea tries to strike a balance between ""local control"" and the simple reality that we need a lot more housing in the most in-demand areas. The idea is roughly this:

Until any first-ring suburb reaches 70% the population density of its principal city, it cannot implement any exclusionary zoning such as SFH exclusivity, large lot sizes, etc. and must allow *regionally-appropriate* multifamily housing everywhere. Once that 70% threshold is reached, they'd have ""done their part"" so to speak and could go back to more exclusive zoning for a while. For second-ring suburbs, that threshold might be 50%. Third ring suburbs might be 30% (make up your own numbers here; these seem reasonable to me). Reevaluate every 5 years or as needed.  

For some context I looked at Boston, which borders 14 municipalities. Some are actually substantially *denser* than Boston proper and would need to do nothing (indeed there are four suburbs denser than Boston and several others already at the 70% mark). Others, though, are sparsely populated, *only 10-20% as dense*, while still enjoying all the same benefits of being near the city. They would be forced to allow a mix of appropriate local housing options. In Boston, this means triple deckers might be back on the menu, where now they are illegal. In Milwaukee it'd mean duplexes, etc. Crucially, no one is asking them to build super high-density towers or other types of housing that would greatly change the character of a place. 

The justification here is simple: if you live near a major city, which gives you access to jobs, entertainment, healthcare, airports, etc., you should expect to have plenty of neighbors, since a lot of other people also want those benefits. This is also more targeted and less top down than the statewide bills that seem popular these days, so it seems like it'd be that much easier to get through a state legislature.

urbanplanning,roadblock,What if there were a city where urban planners reigned supreme?,"I am not an urban planner, but I've become interested in the subject since buying a house, realizing my neighborhood and suburb suck, and discovering why. I have heard that most urban planners actually have a lot of good, helpful ideas about how to design cities but they are thwarted by local residents who either don't know what's good for them or represent a vocal minority of ne'er-do-wells. This got me thinking: what if there were a city in the US that actually embodied the best of what urban planning has to offer? My understanding is that to some extent there exist cities in Europe that are doing really well in this stuff, but even the best examples in the US still have a long way to go. NYC is still infested with cars, Philadelphia public transit is not funded anywhere near where it should be, etc.

Hypothetically, what if a critical mass of people passionate about good urban design all agreed to move to a town that was small enough they could dramatically shift or even completely control its politics? Alternatively, what if they collectively bought undeveloped land and turned it into an urbanist utopia? There exist privately managed master-planned communities that bear a resemblance to this, but they are more like companies than governments if I'm not mistaken. They also tend to be expensive, on too small a scale to really meet all your needs, and are often islands of walkability within the same car dependency that oppresses the rest of the country.

There is actually a precedent for something like this. The [Free State Project](https://www.fsp.org/) is a group of people who have agreed to move to NH to try to shift its politics in a more freedom-oriented direction. The results haven't necessarily been revolutionary, but they have been nothing to sneeze at. (Please note: I'd like to avoid a discussion of whether the policies they advocate for are morally good, I'm merely illustrating that such a movement of people with a common vision can in fact effect change in a US context). The status quo in urbanism is to ""get active at the local level"" but for now that just seems to be getting us disconnected bike lanes, inconsistent public transit, ever-expanding stroads, and the occasional, toothless, incremental upzoning law. Wouldn't it be more effective for the people who actually care about this stuff to concentrate? This way they can build out truly great examples with fewer roadblocks and serve as an example for outsiders to imitate. Imagine people from all over the country visiting an actual example of what urbanists want and going home to demand their city council deliver them the same.

1. What would such a community look like?
2. Is there any way something like this would actually happen?
3. Am I being overly optimistic about what such a community could achieve or otherwise totally off-base?

urbanplanning,roadblock,Possible planning solutions for a city in a hot and humid climate like Houston?,"I'm from Houston, genuinely the worst city to live in for somebody who loves good urban design. I would love to think that if we simply didn't build highways through the city, it could be a walkable and bikeable city. However, a big reason why people don't like walking/biking in Houston is that it is so. god. damn. HOT. all year round. In more bike friendly cities in Europe, the weather is much more accommodating, so it's hard to believe biking would take off well in Houston. The real kicker is the humidity, because it's still hot as hell when your in the shade. It also rains very frequently, which is another roadblock, (or bike block, I should say) However I like to dream, so I have a few ideas that could possibly be work arounds.

1. Tunnels and Skybridges - in downtown, there's a pretty nice system of Air-Conditioned underground pedestrian tunnels and skybridges that connect major buildings and shops. I was fortunate enough that there were entrances right by the LRT stop and my High School, so when it was raining/hot/humid (frequently all 3) it was a nice option. However, I imagine this would be very expensive to have expanded across a significantly larger area. Also, it would work for bikes, however it would be an issue and quite a hassle to move bikes between grades frequently enough to be convenient, since they require very long slopes.

2. Covered Sidewalks - including lots of covered sidewalks, this would protect against rain and heat but not the humidity.

3. Street Trees - Street trees obviously have a huge impact on the temperature of cities, as well as aesthetics, but still wouldn't address humidity

4. More Transit than necessary in a similar city with better climate - simply building a LOT of transit lines so average walk times to the nearest station are minimized. This is obviously very expensive.

urbanplanning,roadblock,"Resources for unraveling ""neighborhood character""?","""Neighborhood character"" usually crops up in policy debates about housing and zoning. Frequently, long-time homeowners tend to rely on this vaguely-defined concept to argue against local changes that would increase diversity of housing tenure (renting, owning, owning a unit and renting out another, etc) or housing typologies (single-family houses, ""missing middle"" buildings, etc). Elected representatives also tend to respond favorably to the invocation of preserving neighborhood character even at the expense of regional economic interests, thus helping to perpetuate the negative externalities of expensive housing in economically productive urban cores. 

What do you think of the concept of neighborhood character, and what are some ways to break it down as a roadblock to sensible urban housing policies? For me it's counterintuitive since, yes, single-family houses will become more valued if neighborhoods don't densify, but increasingly dense neighborhoods can also increase property value by highlighting alternative uses for parcels of land.

urbanplanning,delayed,Bike signals and delays,"An argument made by vehicular cyclists, namely John Forester, is that dedicated bike signals for bike paths cause more delays compared to vehicular cycling. The idea is that when you have bicycle signals, you have additional signal phases to the signal cycle (e.g. motorist right turn occurs during a signal phase where cyclist is prohibited). This either means the total time it takes to cycle through all signals remains the same, leaving cyclists and even drivers with less green time, or the signal cycle is lengthened, leading to a longer wait for cyclists for green.

I'm not an urban planner but I enjoy watching a lot of urbanist videos such as RMtransit of Not Just Bikes. Often they make good points about how transit can be better. The one thing they never seem to talk about is the fact that it's public. The other day I got off the Go (commuter) train from Toronto to Mississauga where I live. You can take the bus free if transferring from the Go train so I though great I'll do this instead of taking the car. I get on the bus and after a few minutes I hear a guy yelling loudly ""You wanna fight!"". Then it keeps escalating with the guy yelling profanities at someone.   
Bus driver pulls over and yells ""Everybody off the bus! This bus is going out of service!"" We all kind of look at each other. Like why is entire bus getting punished for this guy. The driver finally yells to the guy ""You need to behave or I'm taking this bus out of service"". It should be noted I live in a very safe area. So guess how I'm getting to and from to Go station now. I'm taking my car and using the park and ride.

urbanplanning,delayed,Thoughts on government operated autonomous fleets of mid-sized vehicles or minibuses for ride hailing?,"When self driving technology becomes more sophisticated, I think autonomous fleets of small buses that carry 10-20 people would be a suitable replacement for road based public transit. Let me explain how it might work and what problems it will solve. 

Firstly, I own a car and drive most of the time. The main problems I have with public transit are as follows. 

1. Coverage. I need to walk 10 minutes to my nearest bus stop and 20 minutes to the nearest train station. When I get to the network of public transit, I cannot go directly to where I want to go. For CBD destinations, transit takes slightly longer than car for me, but for suburban destinations where I visit frequently, such as for shopping, entertainment, or visiting friends, transit usually takes 3x to 5x the time compared to car. 

2. Other people. In my own car I can relax and listen to music or podcast, talk loudly on the phone, and generally chill. I know my car is clean because I clean it myself. By contrast, I would not be able to kick back and relax on public transit. If seats are available, I don't know they are clean. There are often drunk people, drug users, homeless people, or people exhibiting strange behaviour which I need to watch out for. 

3. Cost. Public transit is not cheap. Total cost of car ownership is more expensive than public transit but given that I own a car already, it is much cheaper per journey to take a car than to pay the transit fares. Public transit is only cheaper if it can completely replace cars. 

My proposed solution is to have fleets of autonomous vehicles which carry 10-20 people, which serve similar functions as buses but can be hailed by an app to board and drop off at specific locations. The vehicles will be optimised by route finding algorithms to balance between carrying the most number of passengers on the route and not causing too much delay to each passenger. This solution would save on labour costs which is a significant cost of operating buses, and will not require any new infrastructure to be built. 

I see this solution as addressing all 3 of the challenges I have listed. Obviously coverage is improved in the same way as existing ride hailing apps. As for undesirable riders, if an app is used to hail rides then the riders can be identified and illegal behaviour can be directly addressed through contact, fines, or legal means. When it comes to cost, a mid sized vehicle should be cheaper than Uber or Lyft while being capable of replacing a car. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. ",0,73,2024-12-08 07:44:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1h98gyw/thoughts_on_government_operated_autonomous_fleets/

urbanplanning,highway,The U.S. should undergo a train building program on the scale of the interstate highway system,"American dependency on cars is not only an environmental issue, or a socioeconomic issue, but a national defense issue.

In the event of a true total war situation, oil, steel, etc. are going to be heavily rationed, just like in world war 2. However, unlike in world war 2, most Americans are forced to drive everywhere. 

In the same way that the interstate highway system was conceived for national defense purposes, a new national program of railroad construction should become a priority. 

The U.S. should invest over a trillion dollars into building high speed rail between cities, subway systems within cities, and commuter rails from cities to nearby towns and suburbs.I should be able to take a high speed train from New York City to Pittsburgh, then be able to get on a subway from downtown Pittsburgh to the south side flats or take a commuter train to Monroeville, PA (just as an example). 

This would dramatically improve the accessibility of the U.S. for lower income people, reduce car traffic, encourage the rebirth of American cities into places where people actually live, and make the U.S. a far more secure nation.

urbanplanning,highway,Top Highways to remove,"In some cities like Buffalo and Rochester, NY highways are being removed. I was wondering what your top candidates would be

Mine are 

1) I-579 between the Allegheny and Monaglahela Rivers.  Removing that interstate reconnects Downtown with Oakland and the Strip District. It also only would cause like a 1-1.5 mile detour for people not getting off the highway 

2) 35-W in Minneapolis: MN 280 is about 12-15 blocks from 35W heading into Minneapolis plus there is already a bottleneck since they merge and diverge NW of Minneapolis 

3) One side of literally any downtown loop. No reason for entire Downtowns to be surrounded. At worst it‚Äôs a minor detour for 1/4 of thru traffic if one side is removed since they are like 1-1.5 miles on each side.

urbanplanning,highway,What If We Made Inner City Highway Loops Into Giant Roundabouts?,"This has been tickling the back of my brain for a few months now. With recent trends (here in America)  exploring highway removal (or covering) in urban downtowns for health, historical, and other reasons, would a roundabout conversion be an affordable first step?

[Here! I doodled on a map of Columbus, Ohio](https://i.imgur.com/t6zzNCF.png)

You could phase this in steadily, too! Close one on-ramp at a time for the clockwise direction every couple weeks. Place some concrete barriers and adjust the stoplight pattern near the ramps accordingly. Place ""ramp closing in two weeks"" signs at the next ramp, and repeat until you're all the way around the loop.

In less than a year, you could close the entire inner loop of a city in one direction. You'd reduce the overall lanes by 50%, but I think the 50% reduction in lanes might only be a 30% reduction in flow after you change stoplight patterns and highway signage reflecting the simpler route.

You could even eliminate the dangerous ""weave zone"" on highways by building new on-ramps in the free space of the closed side, so cars could merge onto the highway from the left and exit on the right.

Point is, it seems excessive (even if you love highways) to have bidirectional highway traffic cutting through a city only a mile or two away from another parallel highway doing the same.

\---

You'd unlock some new land from this, too.

You could fill it in and unlock new land for ""greenfield"" transit-oriented developments right around an existing city core. I think [Columbus, Ohio is the fastest growing city in the country (by percentage)](https://i.imgur.com/hZw15GZ.jpg), and we're behind on housing, so this would be really valuable.

Alternatively, you could also view the closed direction (say, counterclockwise) as a complete, grade-separated path around a city, which could be converted into a metro line loop without lifting a shovel. [Columbus is one of the largest cities in America without ANY rail transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_cities_in_the_United_States_lacking_inter-city_rail_service). Just add tracks, stations, and an optional roof when you have the time.

\---

I dunno. Just brainstorming. Seems like a unique way to only mildly impact traffic yet unlock a lot of new land, narrow the canyons dividing our cities, and do so via a method that requires only few months of serious planning instead of YEARS of coordination, project proposals, funding plans, and bureaucracy. Just a lightweight, high impact, city-changer project for good.

urbanplanning,jam,"We need to wake up! The pandemic is entrenching suburbs for decades to come, and we need to take action now.","There seems to be a general consensus^(1) on r/urbanplanning that the pandemic is not (or at least, should not be, and that the general public will eventually agree it should not be) entrenching suburbs for decades to come, but this appears completely contradictory compared to the present state of the housing market^(2) and the continued glorification of suburban living in North American society. It does not seem logical at all to expect young Americans willingly shifting to missing middle and high density urban housing in the future, especially considering the immense emotional and psychological impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on Millennials, Generation Z, and Generation Alpha, in addition to the focus that news and social media has had on portraying urban living as a major risk factor for contracting COVID-19, despite evidence to the contrary. It seems that in general, the pandemic has provoked a renewed surge from the cities to the suburbs and threatens to make well thought out transit plans for major cities obsolete, casting a stigma on future transportation planning that tries to move away from car-centered development. Furthermore, missing middle housing, high density urban housing, and shifting towards public transportation are not portrayed at all in the popular conception of sustainable living; instead, electric cars, sustainable energy (e.g. rooftop solar panels), and smart houses are widely believed to be the way forward.

In my opinion, r/urbanplanning should have long ago adopted a siege mentality, and acknowledge the reality that most Redditors (generally young liberal Americans), not to mention most Americans in general, do not find any problems with low density suburbs and car dependency; in fact, suburbs are still highly desired, Redditors often complain that they will never be able to own a large, single family home due to housing crises (and proceed to move to smaller, cheaper cities causing even more suburban sprawl creating more housing crises), and electric cars in addition to automated highway systems are seen as the solution to traffic jams and gridlock. If there is any chance for the ideals of mixed-use development, medium- to high-density housing, and high-quality public transportation to take root and grow in our cities in the next 100 years, we need to actively promote said ideals to all levels of government and brush away misconceptions among family and friends that car-dependent suburbia should be the unquestionable paradigm upon which to base our lives. If we cannot strive to change the hearts and minds of our communities and elected officials to bring forth a more sustainable, walkable, and urban future, we are destined to complain online about endless car-dependent suburbia until the end of our days.

An Addendum: (originally posted as a comment reply)

Wealth building should not be solved by homeownership, but by financial investment. I think that instead of the current model, where homeownership is used as wealth building (and thus in opposition to affordable housing & unsustainable in the long-term), zoning restrictions allowing only single family housing should be lifted, government incentives for single family homeownership should be removed, and supply should generally be equal to, if not greater than, demand, limiting the long-term growth of property values to the inflation rate.

The results of this would allow renting and housing overall to become much more economical, and would likely help medium- to high-density developments such as condominiums and apartments to grow in popularity. People would then be strongly recommended (if not mandated) to invest a certain percentage of their income into investment funds that would serve as the main method of wealth building, which would have the additional benefit of supporting public companies and encouraging public participation in business and finance.

Opponents who criticize government intervention in personal finances could be rebuffed by showing that government support of single family housing as a vehicle for wealth building was effectively government intervention into personal finances anyways. For those who would lose a substantial portion of their property values from these reforms and rely on said values for their retirement, they would be compensated by the government since it was ultimately government policy that led to the unsustainable use of homeownership as a vehicle for wealth building.

urbanplanning,jam,Is there a name for the model of a city that promotes the creation of smaller business/comercial clusters to reduce commuting distances? ,"My urban planning or town planning teacher was a big supporter of this idea and I wonder if there's a name for it.
The cities in the XX century grew or were born with the model of a big and unique business and commercial centre where everyone will go to work and suburban areas where people will live with a lower density and calmer streets. This model includes large commuting times and parking needs at the centre. 
Was he was preaching was a model where instead of increasing the centre, you'll create several smaller ones that could allow people to live closer to their work, reducing or diversifying  the commuting times and directions. Not everyone will commute in the same direction and for the same length, so you'll reduce traffic jams increasing quality of life and pollution. Also some of the commuting could be done by bike or walking where distances from home to work are really reduced. 
Is this something you've heard about? Are there more theories about it? Does this concept or model have a name or an author? ",38,39,2024-09-29 19:09:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1fs4l13/is_there_a_name_for_the_model_of_a_city_that/

urbanplanning,jam,Can we talk about transit access to sports stadiums? ,"This is how my state does it. [https://youtu.be/WWIJJCOKV0w](https://youtu.be/WWIJJCOKV0w)

They close the road in front of the stadium to most traffic, only allowing buses and emergency services. So if you catch a footy express service you're getting dropped off out the front.

The foot bridge over the river goes between the stadium and a plaza near the train station. Out the front of the train station there is a tram station. The only driving people might do to get to the footy is to their local train station or transport hub.

This is also the advantage of putting stadiums right on the edge of the city centre.

Adelaide is not the only city that does it like this.

You might recall the confusion this video caused [https://www.tiktok.com/@visitmelbourne/video/7336470013483928840](https://www.tiktok.com/@visitmelbourne/video/7336470013483928840)

The MCG is right on the edge of the Melbourne CBD, there's a train station right there, and trams are nearby too, and it's a short walk from the city centre too.

There's similar videos about the taytay express in Sydney.

Stadiums in Australia have little parking, but lots of transit access. Part of the reason is to reduce traffic, and part is because people drink at stadium events, and we don't want them driving. 

I hear that some stadiums in the US end up with traffic jams when the event is over. It sounds like a massive design flaw. Or is it a feature? Does the stadium or the city gain anything from it?

Is the core of the reason US sports stadiums have so much parking because they charge people to park there? Or is it only because the land is cheap, and the infrastructure poorly designed? And is there a way this could be repaired? Could at least some US sports stadiums reduce their parking by half and incorporate transit access?

Also, how does the US deal with drunk drivers leaving sports stadiums?   
In Australia, it's not unusual for the cops to set up a random breath testing station just down the road from an event where alcohol was sold. Some people call it revenue raising, but really it's saving lives.

urbanplanning,jam,Circular or Straight Line tube?,"I was discussing public transport system in the context of urban planning with a friend. We had very different view on the implementation of such system.

###System Geographical design
I mentioned that more and more city are now building circular line using Paris as an example. I am French but living in London.   nnnn
        
So my question is what would be the most efficient design?        

####Grid system
I argued that for a decentralised 15-minute city, a grid system public transport system is the most efficient. Also unless you have a line directly linking source and destination, a grid system has the advantage of always allowing 2 paths to go from A to B.
All travel from A0 to B1 can be A0-A1-B1 or A0-B0-B1.

A0----------A1.      
|.              |.      
|.              |.      
B0----------B1.      
       

####Circular system
He argued that a set of concentrating circular supplemented by radial lines were more effective.

Imagine a target picture with each color representing a line.
If A and B are on the same circle then again a single choice.
However if A and B are not on the same circle line, unless the radial lines are pretty close, then the distance become bigger.

Empiratically my view is that on average a grid allows a smaller distance and therefore a faster transport.

###Speed Lines
another point of contention was the express line.
My view is that when digging it does make sense to dig deeper and more tunnels at the same time.       
      n
I suggested the following
* Express line that does not stop at every station but every 5 stations. Run every 9 minutes.
* Standard or Slow line. Stops at every station and run every 90 seconds.
* Small Goods line. A slow semi-automated line that allow the transport of small containers (up to a wardrobe size) for the delivery of goods. A Warehouse or a Dark Kitchen at the end of line could then deliver everywhere to the city without any traffic jam delay. London used to have a tunnel dedicated to the delivery of mail. There is no reason why Amazon, Ocado, UberEat, Deliveroo could not pay for something equivalent. Then those will only have to handle the last 100m of delivery.
* Maintenance tunnel. No rail but allow maintenance personnel to travel using golf buggy. The same such tunnel exists in the France-Great Britain under the channel tunnel.

urbanplanning,jam,"Transportation in Antananarivo, Madagascar","Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, counts actually more than 3 million people and is subject to huge congestion and multiple traffic jams. The reason: the design of the city, initially made for half a million people, couldn't follow the chaotic growth of the capital. Currently, the city's main public transportation system consists of old Mercedes bus and taxis, but it's not enough to overcome the main issue.
Also, a recent study made by an international institution evaluated that congestion in Antananarivo created a huge economy loss for the capital city.

As a result, the government tried to bring up solutions: a cable car system and a transit train system.

Actually, Antananarivo is situated in the mountains, meaning there are multiple slopes and hills across the city, making urban planning and road construction quite challenging. There are also vast valleys with rice fields, making Antananarivo a mix of urban and rural landscape. Also, the city, main railway outpost during the colonial period by the French, doesn't have train transportation anymore (except for oil, merchandise, etc.).

The cable car system was chosen as a transportation over subway and tramways for these reasons: the capital's soil is mostly swamped, making underground transportation hard to build, and the tramway isn't an option because of the ricefields and lack of available space. 2-3 years ago, the government signed with a French company the installation of the cable car system but the project is heavily contested: 
- the high cost (150 million $)
- market studies evaluated the ticket price to 8000 ariary (1.6‚Ç¨ or 2$) which is unreachable for most of the population (90% of Malagasy people live with less than 2$ a day)
- the aesthetics of the cable car in the urban landscape
- energy shortages across the city could damage the cable car function system

On another hand, we have the transit train, using the current and unused rail tracks of the city. Still under construction, the transit train will initially use diesel before turning electric. 
The project is less controversial than the cable car for multiple reasons:
- low cost of the ticket (500 ariary or 10-15 cents)
- reuse of the train stations and railway systems, abandoned

So here's the situation in terms of transportation in Antananarivo

urbanplanning,jam,Does density come before or after good public transport?,"In my city, the government is attempting to create a blanket law that will allow multi-family low-rise housing anywhere in the city (both suburbs and inner-city). The argument many of the NIMBYs have made is that this will overload the current traffic network, and does not come with any improvement in public transportation. Their argument is that we need better public transportation first, followed by density, so new residents are more likely to take the bus than drive. So my question is, in this case, are the NIMBYs right, in that we need better public transport to support density later, or does the density need to come first to support public transport?

On a related note, is blanket density a better policy, or should cities pursue corridor-based density instead? To me, corridor-based density seems better as it can support public transport ridership better than density in a transit desert.

Tokyo is very developed, but it is incredibly crowded considering its population. It looks like Bangkok or Manila. LA in the US also has huge traffic jams and New York is extremely crowded.  
  
However, Seoul and Korea are exceptions. Korea is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, but compared to other high-density countries, it feels very empty and it is relatively rare to see crowds.  
  
In other words, infrastructure and level of development is not the only factor.  
  
In Seoul, except for a few places, it is hard to feel that there are really many people on weekdays, but in Japan, where infrastructure is similarly developed, there are a lot of people everywhere you go.  
  
Even in South Korea, there are many urban areas outside of Seoul that are completely ghost towns and where it is difficult to see people.

urbanplanning,jam,The lie of widening highways and road congestion," (A little text explaining something that came to my mind during a shower, a shower thought if you may)

You know the story. A highway is jammed with traffic, the city decides to spend billions of dollars to widen the highway with additional lanes, hundreds of people lose their homes so the traffic will be smoother and in the end the road becomes even more jammed than before. Why is this? Well the answer is both simple and complicated. The simple reason is that people are lazy. However this simple answer doesn‚Äôt explain anything, so I will explain the complicated answer.

An important question to ask is why is a road congested. Most people will think that it is due to the road being too small, but more accurately there are too many people on the road. Keep this in mind, it will literally help explain a lot of problems when it comes to moving things. When a highway has too many drivers on it, people are lazy and just decide to build more lanes because they think the size of the road is the problem and improve that, while not addressing the main root of the problem, which is that there are too many drivers on the road. As such when the highway is expanded with additional lanes, it eventually becomes more congested than before. Why is this, well it is because there are **too many people on the road**, and it is even worse because with more lanes there can be even more ‚Äútoo many people‚Äù. 

What is the solution in this case? Decrease the amount of drivers. However if you wonder why do cities in the US keep widening the highways instead of decreasing the amount of cars, the answer here is laziness. Firstly it is not impossible to decrease traffic, most developed nations, with the Netherlands and Japan on top, have managed to create cities where there is no need for excessively large highways while traffic runs well. The reason the US specifically is unable to do this is because the people and leaders are lazy. It is easier to gain approval for widening a highway and be re-elected to city office by widening a highway as the lazy people will like their easy way of moving around being supposedly helped by the government widening the congested highway. The real way to fix the traffic would be to reduce the amount of drivers, **the root cause of all traffic**, but it would take actual effort like changing city planning codes to allow for more people to live in the same place, to not require more than half the city to be reserved for storing cars instead of people and to give the people a possibility to get around in any other way than driving a multi ton machine of death, like using your legs, using your legs to ride on wheels, go on a big car that can move tens of people along the same route in the space of two cars(which would move two people), a smaller train that goes on track, proper big train or even trains that run below ground. 

Now I must make it clear that not all the people in the US are lazy (even though realistically all of us are lazy, but the Americans are on average lazier in the developed world). There are certainly a lot of people who want to do the non lazy option and several places are actually deciding not to be lazy. However unfortunately a majority of the American people are lazy, and nothing will change if we can‚Äôt convince more of them to not be lazier than most of the developed world. The first thing that must be changed, is the lie that roads are congested due to them being too small when in reality the roads have too many people driving on them.",88,46,2021-05-20 01:01:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/ngerlq/the_lie_of_widening_highways_and_road_congestion/

urbanplanning,jam,Need advice: fire evacuation issue,"I live in a mountainous residential area of a city with 2 main roads that connect it to the rest of the world. Over the past couple of years the city has modified both of these roads from 4 lanes (2 lanes in each direction) to 3 lanes (1 lane in each direction with a center turn lane and bike lanes on either side). Unsurprisingly, we now have traffic jams on both roads at various times during the day and turning has become nearly impossible at certain intersections. While this is annoying for day to day life, that‚Äôs not my biggest concern.

The recent Lahaina fire brought a new concern to the surface. In the event of a fire on our mountain, we would be trapped. Evacuation would be hindered by congested roads. People could die in their cars. Additionally, emergency vehicles would have a hard time getting anywhere during these heavy traffic periods of the day. There are laws and regulations that I believe to have been violated in the modification of these roads.

I heard these even after maintenance fee and installing of mechanism can actually be more affordable than building traditional concrete structures particularly in major cities where land costs are astronomical since they take up much less land.

I be curious how come they don't build more of these particularly in downtown LA or SF or otherlar ge cities where lots and garages take up precious real estate. I can imagine the issue that if its glitchy people would have difficulty getting their cars, losing power, if someone forgets something inside they would need to retrive it from the system but not drive them out delaying people waiting, it would be a bigger issue if a toddler or pet was left inside.

urbanplanning,jam,What to do about cars?,"Ok, I know this is such a broad topic that it seems almost useless to discuss, but I've been thinking about this problem recently and I haven't been able to find even a satisfactory theoretical solution, let alone one that would work in practice. So I'm turning to you all to hear your thoughts.

#Premise

The premise that I'm starting with is that there are many problems associated with cars. Their use causes huge numbers of people to die violently and even more people to be injured. They encourage a sedentary life style that is detrimental to the health of the populace and the finances of the healthcare system. They pollute the environment, both globally, in terms of greenhouse gases, and locally, in terms of noise and irritants. They encourage lifeless cities and public spaces through urban sprawl and low density neighbourhoods. In light of these downsides, it seems that cars are not a good solution to society's transportation needs overall.

#Context

To add a bit of context, I'm from Canada. There are a few major differences that impact this discussion when comparing us to other places, such as the United States or countries in Europe.

The first one is climate. My city, Toronto, has a winter that gets quite cold and quite snowy. It's actually relatively mild compared to many other cities in Canada, but the fact is that snowy or cold conditions can be expected for about 6 months of the year. This is in contrast with places in the Southern US and some parts of Europe that can count on being balmy year round.

The other one is physical geography. Canada is *big* and things are far apart. The province that I live in is about a quarter of the size of the entire European Union, yet has less than 3% of the EU's population. Not only does this affect transportation between cities, it also affects the way that the cities grow, which in turn affects how people move around within the city. There are no real constraints to the size of population centres, and in my region there is perpetual expansion into new areas that are farther and farther away from areas with any density.

In short, the cities are sprawling and far apart, and we have cold and snowy winters.

#The Alternatives

I'm interesting in finding out which mode of transportation will work best for the most common use cases in the environment I describe above. There is a fairly short list of common modes of transportation, so we can start by evaluating those.

1. *Private automobiles:* These currently hold the majority mode share in my city, yet they have the problems outlined above so they are the option we are looking to beat!

2. *Public transit:* Maybe this is primarily a North American issue, but there is considerable stigma associated with using public transit. Few respectable businesspeople would use public transit to get to work. In my city, nobody gets onto a crowded subway car and thinks ""This is it. I've made it. I'm on top of the world."" And so I think public transit has an image issue. And more practically, the experience of being jammed into a bus with no free seats while the guy next to you sweats too much and you're constantly about to fall over as the vehicle lurches through traffic leaves a lot to be desired. And if you think that's bad, try doing it while carrying your week's groceries.

3. *Walking:* For such an important mode, I don't have much to say here. Walking is great, but it doesn't work for trips that are longer than a couple of kilometres. And in my city, that is a minority of trips unfortunately.

4. *Cycling:* Cycling seems to solve many of the problems associated with cars. They're much safer for both the rider and other road users, the physical exertion required has health benefits, they don't pollute in any substantial way, and they promote dense and walkable cities due to their suitability for short distances and smaller footprint infrastructure. In spite of these benefits, there are several reasons why their use remains limited in a North American context. Even for fit adults, cycling farther than 8 km or so (half an hour at city speeds) quickly turns ones morning commute into a sweaty and tiring chore. And that's assuming fair summer weather. Even a bit of rain can transform a short ride into a wet ordeal that requires a shower, or at the very least, a change of clothes at the end of it. And winter is even worse - try taking yourself seriously when your commute necessitates a ski mask to prevent frost bite or wind burn.

5. *Motorcycles:* In practical terms, these offer few benefits for most commuters. They are dangerous (primarily to the rider), require protective gear, require licensing and insurance, yet aren't cheap and don't provide much cargo capacity or protection from the elements.

6. *E-bikes:* Definitely a promising option, as they overcome some of problems associated with cycling, but they are still weak in terms of protection from the elements and rider safety.

7. *Ride sharing:* Having short term access to a private vehicle can be very useful for trips that can't be accommodated by other modes. However, due to the fact that they still dependent on the inefficient automobile, they are expensive and few people who consider them as an option for their daily commute. 

8. *Microtransit:* An extension of the previous mode, I think microtransit will get more attention in the coming years. One form, share taxis (aka minibus taxis), are popular in some areas of the world, but the West has never really taken to them. This may change in the near future however as autonomous driving technology continues to develop.

9. *Autonomous cars:* This one is still up in the air, but I'd be interested in some reasonable speculation if anyone has some to offer.

With these in mind, if cars are the problem, what is the solution?

* Is it simply investing further in one of these existing modes? 
* Or can one be improved in some way to make it more appealing?
* Or is there a new mode that hasn't been fully developed yet?
* Or maybe we're just waiting for a paradigm shift (autonomous cars, transportation as a service, etc)?

I think the fact that this question is so high-level explains why I haven't yet come across discussions that deal with it explicitly.

*The trouble with parking requirements is twofold. First, they don‚Äôt do what they‚Äôre supposed to, which is prevent curb congestion. Because curb parking is convenient and usually free, drivers fill up the curb first, no matter how much off-street space exists nearby.*

But isn't it the case that the off-street parking will still reduce cars driving around hunting for parking, since they would be taken up if there is no street parking within the immediate vicinity of the destination in question?

urbanplanning,congestion,Congestion Pricing Isn't About Congestion,"... or at least it shouldn't be! I see confusion about what congestion pricing can and can't do from [politicians](https://malliotakis.house.gov/media/in-the-news/malliotakis-op-ed-congestion-pricing-unproven-ineffective-and-costly-new-yorkers) and [transit agencies](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2023/february/congestion-charge-marks-20-years-of-keeping-london-moving-sustainably) and sometimes even [academics](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lewis-Lehe/publication/331152719_Downtown_congestion_pricing_in_practice/links/5e8a7ef792851c2f5282c509/Downtown-congestion-pricing-in-practice.pdf). 

The point of congestion pricing shouldn't be to minimize road traffic. The purpose of any transportation system is to be used, so the busier the system is, the better from an economic/land use point of view. The point of the policy should instead be to maximize overall system transportation throughput (i.e., the amount of people and stuff that can move between points). It's easy to see this with an example. 

Imagine a stretch of road without congestion pricing. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume the average vehicle on the road has 1.5 passengers. Now, imagine a congestion charge is applied that fails to meaningfully increase the average speed of the road but that has the effect of increasing the average number of passengers to 2. Many people would point to the program as having failed because it failed to decrease congestion. But such criticism would fail to register the bigger point that road throughput has increased by 33%! 33% percent more people getting to their jobs or patronizing businesses is a massively beneficial economic outcome.

Indeed, experience (e.g., [London and Singapore](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lewis-Lehe/publication/331152719_Downtown_congestion_pricing_in_practice/links/5e8a7ef792851c2f5282c509/Downtown-congestion-pricing-in-practice.pdf)) has shown that in the long run, congestion pricing ends up having a modest impact on congestion. If all you looked at was average speed, you might be inclined to be against the policy, but that misses the key point that  transportation systems are meant to be used to move people and things, and congestion pricing facilitates that.

In the spirit of analyzing congestion pricing as a congestion-alleviation mechanic, much of urbanist/suburbanist analysis of its efficacy focuses exclusively on how congestion pricing policies impact car use (i.e., reducing the number of car trips or increasing car speed), which framing neglects the crucial impact the policy has on bus, metro and bike use--which modes are all higher throughput than cars. Nudging people to higher throughput modes also promotes land value, which encourages density. I don't think it's a coincidence that London, which has had a congestion pricing scheme for 20 years, has arguably the world's [economically most successful mass transit system](https://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-annual-report-and-statement-of-accounts-2018-19.pdf). 

What's the upshot of this throughput-focused framing? 

1. We should stop marketing congestion pricing as a cure to traffic (it isn't)
2. We should evaluate the impact of congestion pricing on overall transportation throughput
3. Analysis of a program's efficacy should also include its impact on land use, including induced density

TL;DR: Congestion pricing doesn't solve traffic; it promotes economic activity. ",41,22,2023-10-08 08:44:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/172orw6/congestion_pricing_isnt_about_congestion/

urbanplanning,congestion,The lie of widening highways and road congestion," (A little text explaining something that came to my mind during a shower, a shower thought if you may)

You know the story. A highway is jammed with traffic, the city decides to spend billions of dollars to widen the highway with additional lanes, hundreds of people lose their homes so the traffic will be smoother and in the end the road becomes even more jammed than before. Why is this? Well the answer is both simple and complicated. The simple reason is that people are lazy. However this simple answer doesn‚Äôt explain anything, so I will explain the complicated answer.

An important question to ask is why is a road congested. Most people will think that it is due to the road being too small, but more accurately there are too many people on the road. Keep this in mind, it will literally help explain a lot of problems when it comes to moving things. When a highway has too many drivers on it, people are lazy and just decide to build more lanes because they think the size of the road is the problem and improve that, while not addressing the main root of the problem, which is that there are too many drivers on the road. As such when the highway is expanded with additional lanes, it eventually becomes more congested than before. Why is this, well it is because there are **too many people on the road**, and it is even worse because with more lanes there can be even more ‚Äútoo many people‚Äù. 

What is the solution in this case? Decrease the amount of drivers. However if you wonder why do cities in the US keep widening the highways instead of decreasing the amount of cars, the answer here is laziness. Firstly it is not impossible to decrease traffic, most developed nations, with the Netherlands and Japan on top, have managed to create cities where there is no need for excessively large highways while traffic runs well. The reason the US specifically is unable to do this is because the people and leaders are lazy. It is easier to gain approval for widening a highway and be re-elected to city office by widening a highway as the lazy people will like their easy way of moving around being supposedly helped by the government widening the congested highway. The real way to fix the traffic would be to reduce the amount of drivers, **the root cause of all traffic**, but it would take actual effort like changing city planning codes to allow for more people to live in the same place, to not require more than half the city to be reserved for storing cars instead of people and to give the people a possibility to get around in any other way than driving a multi ton machine of death, like using your legs, using your legs to ride on wheels, go on a big car that can move tens of people along the same route in the space of two cars(which would move two people), a smaller train that goes on track, proper big train or even trains that run below ground. 

Now I must make it clear that not all the people in the US are lazy (even though realistically all of us are lazy, but the Americans are on average lazier in the developed world). There are certainly a lot of people who want to do the non lazy option and several places are actually deciding not to be lazy. However unfortunately a majority of the American people are lazy, and nothing will change if we can‚Äôt convince more of them to not be lazier than most of the developed world. The first thing that must be changed, is the lie that roads are congested due to them being too small when in reality the roads have too many people driving on them.",86,46,2021-05-20 01:01:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/ngerlq/the_lie_of_widening_highways_and_road_congestion/

When I skimmed through Kockelman's work, I wasn't able to find the part which said that density and congestion had a positive relationship (as it is rather long). So I'm rather skeptical of Randal's postulation.

Congestion pricing is said to be very effective but also very unpopular at the political level.   But what about voluntary peer-to-peer congestion pricing?  Those who insist/need to be on the roads at rush hour pay into a pool that is used to incentivized more flexible commuters to either change their schedule, mode or stay off the roads entirely.

If we can ignore the logistics of implementing this for a moment (which I believe to be difficult, but solvable), how would traffic engineers react to the possibility of influencing traffic patterns in this way?

urbanplanning,incident,One big reason people don't take public transit is that it's public,"I've been trying to use my car less and take more public transit. I'm not an urban planner but I enjoy watching a lot of urbanist videos such as RMtransit of Not Just Bikes. Often they make good points about how transit can be better. The one thing they never seem to talk about is the fact that it's public. The other day I got off the Go (commuter) train from Toronto to Mississauga where I live. You can take the bus free if transferring from the Go train so I though great I'll do this instead of taking the car. I get on the bus and after a few minutes I hear a guy yelling loudly ""You wanna fight!"". Then it keeps escalating with the guy yelling profanities at someone.   
Bus driver pulls over and yells ""Everybody off the bus! This bus is going out of service!"" We all kind of look at each other. Like why is entire bus getting punished for this guy. The driver finally yells to the guy ""You need to behave or I'm taking this bus out of service"". It should be noted I live in a very safe area. So guess how I'm getting to and from to Go station now. I'm taking my car and using the park and ride.  
This was the biggest incident but I've had a lot of smaller things happen when taking transit. Delayed because of a security incident, bus having to pull over because the police need to talk to someone and we have to wait for them to get here, people watching videos on the phones without headphones, trying to find a seat on a busy train where there's lots but have the seats are taken up by people's purses, backpacks ect.   
Thing is I don't really like driving. However If I'm going to people screaming and then possibly get kicked of a bus for something I have no control over I'm taking my car. I feel like this is something that often gets missed when discussing transit issues.

urbanplanning,incident,"In Metro Detroit, the current narrative surrounding our ""urban density"" is without a doubt the biggest roadblock that's standing in the way of change and progress","This topic covers two main strands of discourse in this region:

## 1) Transit:

There has been a disappointing amount of backpedaling regarding ambition for the scope of transit after the [RTA's 2016 proposal failed](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/11/09/rta-regional-transit-authority-millage/93535602/) at the ballot. It seems like the takeaway that transit planners of this region got from the defeat was that the plan was ***too ambitious*** and should be scaled back instead of tabling a more robust proposal ([if you look at the RTAs 2023 ""update""](https://rtamichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RTA-2023RMTPUpdate-FINAL.pdf), you'll see that they're not even asking for more money than they were back in 2016 despite cutting ***all*** of the regional routes they suggested outside of the main 4 corridors).

Since the 2016 loss and the onset in this scarcity, austerity urbanist mindset, the argument that ***""Metro Detroit is too sprawled out to have rail transit""*** has been popping up more frequently as certain urbanists/transit enthusiasts grow disillusioned with political leaders in this region/state due to their complacency.

It's very grating to me that this argument keeps on being presented when it's easily defeated with 6 minutes of googling:


City | City Density (sq. mi)| Metro Density (sq. mi)
---|---|----
Detroit | 4,606 | 2,939
Calgary | 5,439 | 753
Denver | 4,674 | 4,167
Atlanta | 3,685 | 1,997
Twin Cities | 5,994 (St. Paul) 7,962 (Minneapolis) | 2,594

All of the metro areas (except Detroit) that I included have some form of rail transit and don't vary too much from our urban density. This point needs to be drilled into the heads of every single political leader in the state by local urbanists and we need to call them out whenever they attempt to propose the opposite.

##2) Taxes:

This is more of an issue for the entire Rust Belt region rather than Detroit and most of it's inner ring suburbs, for example, ***[the vast majority of the 15 cities with the most expensive property taxes in the country have been struggling with population loss](https://constructioncoverage.com/research/cities-with-the-highest-property-taxes-2023)***. The Other cities included are Texan cities who don't levy certain taxes that the Rust Belt cities do. The conversations surrounding the Detroit Mayor's LVT proposal has focused on suggesting that ***""the city's property taxes are the biggest obstacle to Detroit's recovery""***. But, even in a report that suggested ending tax incentives (including waiving property taxes) wouldn't likely end until 2053, [the Citizen's Research Council of Michigan said this](https://crcmich.org/PUBLICAT/2020s/2024/memo1177-Detroit_Economic_Condition_Economic_Development_Efforts.pdf) about the policy of property tax breaks (found on page 15):

> Effects on income distinct from increases in employment were not observed in reviewed research. Positive effects on employment and property values were
observed, two components to economic activity used
in this report. **Despite these positive observations,
each study noted the same difficulties in measurement
in that it is nearly impossible to discern whether a
business would have located or expanded within a jurisdiction with or without tax subsidies. How commonly
and freely tax subsidies are awarded in Detroit and
across the country undermine this type of analysis.**

There hasn't been any study or article that I've seen to suggest that it's practice of offering tax incentives has allowed revenue to grow in other areas to offset the lost revenue. Detroit needs to pinch every penny that it possibly can, [since Detroit's future pension obligations](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2023/12/08/detroit-police-fire-pension-lawsuit-20-year-payment-plan/71841904007/) are being fought in court, we have a scenario where, if we choose to minimize our obligations to our pensioners then we might effect the willingness of workers to find employment within city government, or, if we decide to give former employees their pensions in the timeframe that we promised them, we'd have to implement austerity. Both outcomes would drastically alter the city's future budget one way or another.",58,39,2024-02-25 18:58:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1aznx5q/in_metro_detroit_the_current_narrative/
urbanplanning,incident,I always forget how fragile public transport is,"I live in San Francisco. This is supposed to have one of the better transport networks in all of North America.

And yet buses and subway trains are constantly late. Buses are held up in traffic. Trams and trains have mechanical problems.

There's a higher degree of social disorder here compared to Asian/European cities with similar population and density, so crime sometimes delays the train.

I understand advocating for public transport and it's an excellent way to take advantage of existing infrastructure. And it's efficient for moving many people over a long distance.

But I can't get past how something like a car accident or police incident can disrupt 20k riders to be 15 minutes late. Many of those riders then miss subsequent train or bus connections.

It requires such tight tolerances for every mechanical and human interaction in order to run smoothly.",238,62,2022-07-03 13:22:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/vqcfpm/i_always_forget_how_fragile_public_transport_is/

urbanplanning,incident,Crosswalks at T-Intersections,"When designing a T-Intersection with traffic lights, are there any best practices to follow for pedestrian crosswalks?

In the link below (just a sample of an intersection that I found online), you can see that the intersection has 3 crosswalks. Should T-intersections have 3 crosswalks, or only 2? If they only have 2, should the crosswalk be on the left or the right (see photo) - I am in the US, so this is for places where you drive on the right side of the road. Basically if a car is driving towards the T intersection and needs to make either a right or left turn, should the crosswalk be in the path of a driver making a left turn, in the path of a driver making a right turn, or on both sides? 

There have been some pedestrian incidents at a specific crosswalk in our town, and we are hoping to speak with the town board about some changes to make it safer. The current intersection has a crosswalk in the path of drivers making a left turn. 

Thank you! Sorry if this is confusing to explain without a diagram haha

urbanplanning,incident,Clearing the Air,"*During the 1996 Olympics, more than 2 million visitors descended on the city of Atlanta, effectively increasing the city's population by 50 percent. Most of the visitors -- I was among them -- spent many hours huffing around the hot, crowded sports venues. Yet, during this time asthma hospitalizations surprisingly declined by a full 30 percent. What happened?*  
**The difference was walking.**

Quote from Book: Walkable City: How downtown can save America.  


So I decided to make a little research, and here is what I got.

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/21/health/study-finds-reduced-asthma-during-atlanta-olympics.html) Says Traffic controls imposed during the Atlanta Olympics contributed to a 23% decrease in morning peak traffic counts and a 10% decline in weekend peak traffic counts. This resulted in a 13% fall in ozone concentrations, a 19% decrease in carbon monoxide levels, and a 7% decline in nitrogen dioxide levels, the authors report. (NYT says that hospitalizations declined by 43%)

So does car emissions connected to that, or only the walk made this much against asthma?

The [European Respiratory Journal](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/33/6/1261) says the risk of developing asthma was also significantly related to living close to a major road. The current study suggests that elevated levels of vehicle exhaust outside the home increase the risk of onset and incident asthma among adults.

So, the book says that Difference was walking, is that true? [Walking For Health UK](https://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk/get-walking/walking-health-conditions/walking-and-asthma#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20asthma%2C%20improving,walking%20further%20as%20you%20progress) says  If you have asthma, improving your fitness can be a great way for you to increase your lung capacity and help you to relax. Walking is a great way to improve your fitness - building up slowly and getting faster or walking further as you progress.¬†

urbanplanning,incident,What are the consequences of a developer making a misrepresentation in a presentation to a public body?,"I'm trying to figure out how to view this incident which I discovered in the record of a public meeting held in my city earlier this month.  ""Developer"" is a real estate investment firm which recently purchased an office campus, ""Blackacre.""  It wants to demolish the existing structures and re-build Blackacre into a somewhat larger, predominantly residential campus-style development, which it claims is consistent with City's Comprehensive Plan.  Its argument, put forth at a meeting of the Common Council, is that campus-style office space in the region is experiencing high vacancy rates and becoming commercially non-viable.  In the context of this argument, it tells the Common Council that Blackacre has a 49% vacancy rate.  

Later, an astute citizen reviews Developer's website.  The website, which is investor-oriented, talks about a similar redevelopment by Developer in a neighboring town, saying ""Over time, less desirable office space was \*systematically vacated\* to facilitate mixed-use redevelopment."" (Emphasis added.)

The citizen brings this up in the public comments portion of the Common Council meeting.  Thereafter, the language on Developer's website is changed to ""Over time the less desirable office space was re-zoned to facilitate mixed-use redevelopment.""

In other words, it appears there is a good chance that the vacancy rate is currently 49% only because Developer has been systematically and intentionally vacating Blackacre.

Thus, it appears Developer intentionally misled the Common Council to believe the 49% rate is the organic result of a poor market for office space.  

What happens in this situation?  What \*should\* the Common Council do?  Can / should they investigate?  Do they have any investigatory powers themselves (like subpoenas)?  Can they refer to someone to investigate?  Can / should they do anything to sanction Developer for its misrepresentation?",7,6,2021-06-20 07:39:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/o3v940/what_are_the_consequences_of_a_developer_making_a/

urbanplanning,incident,Discussion: What would be the prerequisites for a 'perfect city'?,"Now, I know we can't plan 'perfect cities', because almost every time someone tried, it didn't turn out the way they hoped, but I'm hoping we could talk about what would be best prerequisites for such cities. 

I'll make my suggestion, and don't hold back on the critique. I'm hoping this thread can be a place for trying out your theories and getting them challenged. Also, feel **free to skip my suggestion and just enlighten us with your own**.


What I think is a perfect city: A city that most resource-efficiently (maybe even sustainably) creates the most prosperity.

Here are my *thoughts* (emphasis on 'thoughts', because these are purely hypotheses I made from own views and a variety of books):

**Taxation**: This city has [Pigovian taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax) - cars, meat, space (as in road or building space efficiency) and every other commodity has the social cost included in the price, so that if people pay for something, they are also paying for what it costs to society. Basically you will succeed by creating the most happiness out of as little as possible. You are using what's available - not more than that - no artificially low prices creating overproduction. This will make the goal of making money also be a goal of doing the best thing to advance as a city - both from the perspective of a company and an individual. The reason this will happen is because doing the best thing to make your city develop in this way will also be the best way to make money when you have Pigovian taxes. It should have an open system, where academics and research pursue changing this taxation all the time to get it continuously closer to what's real by working with statistics and cost allocating different spots in the city budget. I imagine a website with very easy-to-use mathematic formulas and detailed descriptions on how the formula is calculated with ways to test what would decrease the cost the most. People would get educated on how to reduce their taxes the most in schools. 

To paint a picture of Pigovian taxation: 

* Trashing stuff might be included in product prices, so everyone will have the incentive to reuse, reduce and recycle. It should be labelled ""trash tax"" and be able to get lower if companies provide ways to ensure that the product will not get trashed. Statistics will be the model for the new trash tax. If the average consumer of the product throws out xx kg, the price of the product should include what it costs to trash the product. The formula for the calculation of that price also accounts for the [environmental issues associated with that](http://greenlivingideas.com/2015/04/24/how-our-trash-affects-the-whole-planet/). If the product cost too much, people won't buy it, and the company is forced to think of ways to reduce the tax. Companies will start making products that are easier to reuse or recycle and someone can even start a business making money on building systems that do that. We might see more people like [this girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDQcBQUDpw). We might also see more people taking extra time to buy items they actually want, which creates a higher demand for high-quality goods that creates better jobs. Instead of throwing furniture out, we might see people painting them, sewing them together, repairing them and we will see a whole new market for repairing items saving lots of resources in the process. Or even a whole new market for sending your furniture to be personalised. All this because companies pay fewer taxes for not contributing to trashing and extensive resource use. They will earn more by creating something that lasts (that includes creating something that people want to keep, something that doesn't break) and when it gets out-fashioned or breaks the companies can redesign it or repair it. 

* Energy and water would be more expensive and consumers would be more energy efficient. It‚Äôs very hard to keep track of where you spend most energy or water. Imagine if a company wants to make a stove, oven, TV, showers or lightswitches that actually shows how much money you are spending as you are using the product. Who would buy that? Now only environmental hipsters, but what if energy costed the real cost?

* Roads will be self-financed - car drivers will of course pay for it‚Äôs own trashing, pay per-mile-tax (which will have a formula for vehicle weight and size incentivising small vehicles) for road maintenance, pay gas tax for pollution and resource use, pay for having a car for it's space use (Read Leigh Gallagher - the High Cost of Free Parking), pay for entering cities as they make noise, which has [social costs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/06/24/researchers-latest-obsession-the-stress-of-urban-noise-on-your-body/?tid=a_inl), and contributes to a worse public life - you all know [Jan Gehl](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/08/jan-gehl-make-cities-liveable-urban-rethinker) right? 
This certain way of taxing cars in different ways will also ensure that electric and driverless cars will be less expensive than regular vehicles, but they will still be expensive because of all the other negative externalities (indirect costs). No artificial subsidies. 
Cars will be very expensive, but some people might want to prioritise having a car, and they can still get one because there will still be a market for it, but it will be smaller because every taxpayer won't be the ones paying for that to happen. [Relevant article from City Lab: The Real Reason US Gas is so Cheap is Americans Don‚Äôt Pay the True Cost of Driving](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/01/the-real-reason-us-gas-is-so-cheap-is-americans-dont-pay-the-true-cost-of-driving/384200/).

The tax will make driving expensive enough that people will only drive for certain incidents (such as child pick-up or large products), and even then, because of demand, there will be a resource-efficient supply. Either (with the child pick-up problem): schools will be more scattered, and neighbourhoods will be safe enough for children to walk alone. Or: Someone will have created a much more resource efficient way of travel for those incidents - such as a bike-with-storage-shops or [Christiania Bike](http://www.cykelshoppen.dk/img/co/174.jpg) sharing.  

* People will only eat meat on special occasions, and, because of its demand, either a new market of delicious meatless dishes will open up, or scientists will have discovered [a vegan way to make something very similar to meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpQl9V9yoA). Food will be more local, because of the travel costs and urban gardening will be profitable. 

* Social businesses will thrive - If you have a business that saves money on the city budget, Pigovian taxation means that you can get paid. That could create a whole new way of thinking of working in the public sector. - The public sector would be privatised in a way, but in a right way. If you are interested in this, look up [social impact bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact_bond). The needs of the city will be met naturally. 

* I think we are beginning to share the idea that proximity is far less costly than mobility. Because of that, I believe that in a city with Pigovian taxation people will live closer because they will have incentives to do so. They will have incentives to do so because the use of space is accounted for as a scarce resource in the home price market. The efficiency derived from living close will also be accounted for in these prices. The incentive for living in walkable neighbourhoods is even higher when you compare the price of the lifestyle of a place, where you need a car. [Suburban Sprawl is Killing the Environment - IB Times](http://www.ibtimes.com/how-suburban-sprawl-killing-environment-1552536) - or almost any urban planning documentary or books by Jeff Speck, Charles Montgomery or Leigh Gallagher. 
If they don't want to, they can prioritise living in a bigger home. There will be a market for that - it will just not be that big, because people *choose* not to prioritise that. It's important to note that at any point, no choice is taken away, you are just paying a real cost, not an artificial one. 
We might see more dorms or similar housing types and bigger families living together. When people live closer (maybe together), they tend to be much more efficient in regards to helping each other, making meals for each other, helping with social issues, sharing innovation, etc. Other than that, fewer resources per citizen are needed for maintenance, amenities, electricity and resource use if people live in smaller and closer spaces. They might share TV, tools, kitchen and other stuff that has a longer lifecycle than the time a consumer can use it. Cities will be more compact, saving space for nature. Based on Colin Ellard, we would have more trees because natural edges and shapes make us calmer. The cost of people getting stressed from living in close spaces will also be accounted for if that happens because 'stress' creates social costs. This knowledge will create a market for designing in a way that makes people less stressful and optimising the space people need.

* Buildings will be designed for people, because [people get stressed from boring streets](https://aeon.co/essays/why-boring-streets-make-pedestrians-stressed-and-unhappy) and because of the [benefits of cities built for people](http://gehlarchitects.com/blog/how-do-we-design-healthy-cities-for-people/). 


**Work**: This city has looser work times - people would have a chance to do things that matter to their community and you will see more distinct areas and more local practises of art. Longing the time people has to work is a short-term solution to creating GDP, which in the long term is counterintuitive. The more people have to work on their obligations, the less time they have to improve their community, their health, their mind and the happiness of themselves and others. 

**Innovation**: This city has platforms of sharing innovation - the two above points would create many small, close communities who do things very differently (and, therefore, have some innovation to share) *because* they are small and close communities. That will have a tendency of happening because people will live closer to where they work and shops will be more local. More intimate communities will also mean that businesses will thrive better locally because they know what that community needs. Network theory: When smaller clusters in a bigger network connect, great opportunities for innovation ensues. They just need that connection. I like Kent Larsons idea, ‚ÄúCompact Urban Cells‚Äù [at 5:00 in this video](https://www.ted.com/talks/kent_larson_brilliant_designs_to_fit_more_people_in_every_city). 

**Government**: Government is more local - we need boundary spanners (people who connect two network clusters) in the small communities that speak both the language of the communities and other local boundary spanners. The power is much more in the hand of research (well thought out arguments in research papers) and the free economy. 

**Education**: Education is better and has more freedom (Freedom in the sense that education is less costly and in the meaning that people can choose more freely what they want to study) and research will be much more easily funded - If people are able to have a little more freedom in choosing courses, a lot of opportunities might arise: People will be better at communicating across practises, research will be more diverse and innovative, people will share knowledge more, we will be able to make better decisions and fight less over rights, because we know better how each other think. Other than that the pressure of not knowing what to do at a young age will be replaced by a curiosity of taking courses that match your current interests and lead you to research that no one else has thought of - resulting in the creation of new ideas. Of course this will be balanced to a point that makes the most sense, because it will be expensive. In the first part of the education system (high school and before) people should learn more about philosophy, cautions about the internet, society, how to make decisions including how to vote (without propaganda), about personal finance, art and much more. 

**Social hierarchies**: In this city, the gap between wealthy and poor is small or maybe non-existent - I don't know much about this, but I am aware that [the higher social gap a country has, the more social problems it has](http://inequality.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/health-inequality-health-and-social-problems-worse-in-more-uneaqual-countries.png). 

**Regulation**: Planning and other rules and regulations are ongoing processes in communication with education, and regulation is looser - Housing, office space and business is more mixed because that is what the market naturally wants to do. Buildings will be more diverse and have distinct expressions of the values in their communities. Rules and regulations will update after what research finds out. We won't need that much regulation because we will have a more trusting society because when someone makes decisions for themselves, it will naturally also be the best decision for everyone else. This is also a part of why I think Pigovian taxes while being implemented by the government, creates a platform for having a much more free market. City planning might go down to just planning path- and street networks, having height regulations and taxation based on how much space you use and how much you devalue other‚Äôs housing, but I need to research more on the pragmatic part about that. 

To clear a few things up:

* The city should be developed naturally and with very thought-out, but not thorough planning

* A change like this in the real world would crash a lot of markets and make a lot of people unemployed, but a gradual change might not. 

There's probably more, but this is what I could think of right now. 

It's naive, visionary and very far from how it is now. Much of it is uncertain, which is why I want it challenged, but this is what I believe right now based on discussions, lots of reading on this sub and r/economics and books on urban planning and economics. 

I believe this is very important if we want a way to live sustainably (meaning ‚Äúat all‚Äù in the future) and not have the consumption of three earths. At the same time I think it will create a city where everyone feels they have more meaning to life, because all work will add to the value of the city and your sense of belonging not only for the environment, but also for the well-being. 

Challenge me. What do you think?

That's why they have decided to elaborate their own evaluation grid, adapted to their context and skills. The grid presented below has been developed during studies of water management of the urban project ""Lyon- confluence"".

The assessed criteria are: social, environmental, economical and governance:
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Limitation of nuisance (noise, odours) and intervention frequency
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Reduction of work hardness,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Protection against flooding,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Limitation of natural resources consumption (water, energy),
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Limitation of impacts on natural environment,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Limitation of waste production,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Limitation of investment cost,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Limitations of operation cost,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Possibility for the solution to be modified as the project advances,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Clearness of the presentation of the project - understandable by non-scientific public,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Integration of works in the city, adaptation to future uses,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	Integration of the water cycle in urban planning.
For each solution, a mark is given for each criterion:
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	1 if the criterion is taken into account in the solution,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	-1 if the criterion is not taken into account in the solution,
√¢‚Ç¨¬¢	0 if there is no incidence.",1,0,2012-04-29 07:47:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/sxmms/frances_longterm_project_planned_until_2030/
transportation,traffic,[Idea] High Traffic Variable Speed Limit,"Any time I have to deal with commute traffic on the freeway (which is thankfully rare) I try to figure out what the *actual* rate of movement is instead of the posted maximum.  Posted 65mph doesn't help me and can go to hell when it's bumper to bumper.  The trick is to drive at a consistent speed without needing to put on the brakes, which results in driving slower and coasting at a steady speed (this is normally 20-30mph, depending).  It started off as a game for me after seeing a video from a guy in Seattle trying this, and then got to thinking, ""if everyone else did this we would eliminate stop-and-go traffic"".

In my mind, here's how it would work: The local news is able to report high traffic based on sensors imbedded into the roadways -- with a pair of sensors, set a fixed distance apart, you can determine the rate of travel based off the delay between pings.  We also have reader boards on major freeways that report construction, etc.  Why not link the two?

Calculate an average speed and then post a *recommended* speed (like yellow warning signs for tight corners) that would enable all drivers to move at a constant rate.  This wouldn't change the legal posting, just make it easier on everyone.

This would lower everybody's blood pressure, stress, increase vehicle longevity and make driving a lot safer (but mainly less rage inducing).

I imagine it would take a little bit for people to get use to, but I feel the results would speak for themselves.  All the infrastructure exists, it just needs to be connected.  It makes sense in my head (and I hope I explained it clearly), but would this be feasible?  I can't imagine it costing much since all of the components already exist, but what are some of the hurdles for this kind of idea?

**TL;DR** - Link road sensors with reader boards to post a recommended speed during times of congested traffic.",8,9,2013-09-12 08:28:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Transportation/comments/1m8102/idea_high_traffic_variable_speed_limit/

The bus makes two stops in NYC, the 2nd of which I was bound for. The driver told me that I could stay put and got to that stop, when in fact I needed to switch to another bus to go to that stop. I only made it because the driver who was about to take me back to State College asked me for a ticket. The other bus was, by the way, driven by the guy who told me I didn't need to switch.

transportation,traffic,"Idea to improve pedestrian safety, specially pedestrians busy with phones. Please provide feedback!","Link: http://goo.gl/ot1qF4 
Idea is to build a software solution to improve pedestrian saftey.
Solution details: Existing infrastructure relies on a ""heads-up"" visual awareness; for a society frequently buried in smart devices we believe that pedestrian signaling must be extended to the screens of smart devices. TUG sends localized phone-based alerts to pedestrians approaching crosswalks for which they do not have right of way. The solution specifically targets phone-engaged pedestrians who fail to take notice of pedestrian signaling. By re-engaging pedestrian attention to traffic signaling we believe TUG will help reduce phone-distraction related collisions. 
This is part of a competition and winning will help us take it closer to execution.
We developed a working prototype and a video so if you like it please vote here: http://goo.gl/ot1qF4",2,0,2014-09-25 11:56:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Transportation/comments/2hepjd/idea_to_improve_pedestrian_safety_specially/
transportation,traffic,"""A 1985 report based on British and American crash data found driver error, intoxication and other human factors contribute wholly or partly to about 93% of crashes""","Over the past few years I've developed a growing interest in the automobile infrastructure of this country. I've spent a great deal time on the road and I see driving for what it really is: a burden and a danger. Congestion has overburdened highways and roads and has made them an inefficient mode of transportation, wasting a great deal of time (I've heard/read that the average American sits in traffic for 2 weeks per year) and resources (gas, brakes from stop and go traffic, etc.). Traveling by car is a risk, over 30,000 people die each year in the United States from car crashes (according to the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/costs/index.html)). And that's only the number of people who will die, millions more will be injured. There's plenty of data out there classifying car crashes based on crash type, time of day, location, etc. But I want to know what's behind the numbers. I want to know what the major factors are in car crashes.

So of course like any good researcher I went straight to Wikipedia and found a page titled [Traffic collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision). I scrolled down to section 2, titled *Causes*, which immediately made reference to a ""1985 study by K. Rumar, using British and American crash reports as data"" that claimed that ""driver error, intoxication and other human factors contribute wholly or partly to about **93%** of crashes."" Wikipedia provides a link to a 1995 publishing in the Federal Highway Administration's magazine [Public Roads](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/95winter/p95wi14.cfm) that uses the data from the study in this [chart](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/95winter/imgs/p95wi17.gif), but not provide a link to the original study itself. Nor does Wikipedia even reference the study by name, although it didn't take me long to find it:

K. Rumar. ""The Role of Perceptual and Cognitive Filters in Observed Behavior,"" Human Behavior in Traffic Safety, eds. L. Evans and R. Schwing, Plenum Press, 1985.

After quite a bit more searching I was not able to find the original report from 1985. But I have found a number of other papers, book, and reports that cite this study, which leads me to believe its legitimacy.

My interest in these numbers stems from a desire to try to makes roads safer. And the only way to do that is to know what makes them dangerous. If vehicle error is only responsible for 2% of all car crashes, shouldn't we be more focused on other collision factors? We can make a car as safe as possible but if there's still an idiot behind the wheel and there are still monstrous potholes there's still a reasonable chance of an accident. And if human error still plays a part in 93% of all accidents, shouldn't we be focusing on putting better drivers on the road? Perhaps more rigorous license requirements, better driver education and stricter driving laws and punishments would keep bad drivers off the road to reduce the number of collisions and subsequent fatalities. I would love to hear some thoughts on these issues. With the enormous number of automobiles on U.S. roads today and the massive volume of congestion, a numerical/statistical analysis of accidents and their cause may prove to be eye-opening. 

So here are some questions for any redditors with any relevant knowledge: Are these findings still relevant today? Can we still attribute some form of human error or negligence to be wholly or partly responsible for 93% of all collisions? More/less? And what about the other numbers in the chart (such as vehicular error being responsible for a mere 2% of all vehicle collisions), do they mean anything on today's roads or are they outdated.

transportation,delayed,I attempted to prevent a potential act of terrorism but was instead treated like a criminal by Spirit Airlines,"I was booked on a Spirit flight to Fort Lauderdale departing Chicago O‚ÄôHare at 5:30p. Once boarded on the aircraft I sat there hoping the seat next to me would remain open. As the last man boards the aircraft, he walks up to my row and sits in the seat across the aisle from me and places his bag under the seat in front of him. The captain then announces the oxygen mask in the cockpit is malfunctioning so we are going to be delayed. I put in my ear buds and take a quick nap. 45 minutes later I am awoken to an announcement from the captain stating we are preparing to depart. The doors are quickly closed and the air hostess begins the safety instructions. At this point the man who was last seated in the flight is missing, but his bag is still present under the seat. I look at the bathroom at the front and rear of the plane but both lights were green indicating both were vacant. This causes immediate alarms to go off in my head, but I was unsure how to approach the situation. The two passengers sitting in the same row as the missing man mention his absence to the hostess. She shrugs her shoulders and says, ‚Äúoh well‚Äù they then inform her that his bag is still on the plane. She takes the bag to the hostess in the front of the plane (Sherron) and then places it in the overheard bin while muttering, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs that‚Äù as she passes by my row. Two passengers in the row immediately in front of the missing man are informed of the situation by the conversation of the two men in the aisle of the missing man. At this point we are taxi-ing the runway. A man stands up to voicing his concern of the unattended bag on the aircraft. Sherron responds by announcing on the overhead speaker for him to sit down. Once the aircraft comes to a stop she approaches him and asks him, ‚Äúwhat do you think you are doing?‚Äù she is informed of the situation but responds with ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine‚Äù. This is when I can no longer remain silent so I ask, ‚ÄúWhy is it ok that an unattended bag is on this flight?‚Äù Sherron responded with ‚Äúits fine, do you understand that?‚Äù I reply, ‚ÄúNo, I do not understand why it is fine‚Äù To which she responds, ‚Äúwe are going back to the gate‚Äù. Before reaching the gate, the doors open and two police offers board the aircraft. Sherron brings them to our aisle and point out 4 passengers (Chris, Sean, Laura, & myself) and we are escorted off the flight. One officer informs us that we could be imprisoned for 10 years for arguing with an airhostess and walks away. Another police officer listens to our explanation of events and seems concerned but does not take notes or action. We are led back to the terminal and told we need to present ID and again informed we could be imprisoned for 10 years. At this point Lisa introduces herself as the General Manager for Spirit. She informs us that we have caused a commotion on the flight and are not going to be allowed to board any flight to Florida. She leaves us to go converse with the Police Officers. At this point all 4 of us are on our phone notifying our families of the situation and I watch the aircraft take off with the bag still on board. Laura‚Äôs sister-in-law is a lawyer and notifies Lisa of it as she approaches us. Lisa immediately walks away from us and gets on her phone. We are then escorted to the ticketing counter, by the Spirit personnel without the police, and informed that we are being refunded the value of our ticket and free to go. When voicing our concern about how the situation was handled, Lisa left us with this, ‚Äúwhy are 4 people not related to once another worried about 1 bag?‚Äù implying we are being suspicious by voicing our concern about an unattended bag being left on a flight.

Instead of being concerned about the welfare of its passengers and commending those who report suspicious activity, Spirit airlines left the unattended bag on the flight while bullying 4 well-intentioned passengers.",2,0,2014-04-18 19:54:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Transportation/comments/23cvcp/i_attempted_to_prevent_a_potential_act_of/

transportation,highway,"""A 1985 report based on British and American crash data found driver error, intoxication and other human factors contribute wholly or partly to about 93% of crashes""","Over the past few years I've developed a growing interest in the automobile infrastructure of this country. I've spent a great deal time on the road and I see driving for what it really is: a burden and a danger. Congestion has overburdened highways and roads and has made them an inefficient mode of transportation, wasting a great deal of time (I've heard/read that the average American sits in traffic for 2 weeks per year) and resources (gas, brakes from stop and go traffic, etc.). Traveling by car is a risk, over 30,000 people die each year in the United States from car crashes (according to the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/costs/index.html)). And that's only the number of people who will die, millions more will be injured. There's plenty of data out there classifying car crashes based on crash type, time of day, location, etc. But I want to know what's behind the numbers. I want to know what the major factors are in car crashes.

So of course like any good researcher I went straight to Wikipedia and found a page titled [Traffic collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision). I scrolled down to section 2, titled *Causes*, which immediately made reference to a ""1985 study by K. Rumar, using British and American crash reports as data"" that claimed that ""driver error, intoxication and other human factors contribute wholly or partly to about **93%** of crashes."" Wikipedia provides a link to a 1995 publishing in the Federal Highway Administration's magazine [Public Roads](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/95winter/p95wi14.cfm) that uses the data from the study in this [chart](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/95winter/imgs/p95wi17.gif), but not provide a link to the original study itself. Nor does Wikipedia even reference the study by name, although it didn't take me long to find it:

K. Rumar. ""The Role of Perceptual and Cognitive Filters in Observed Behavior,"" Human Behavior in Traffic Safety, eds. L. Evans and R. Schwing, Plenum Press, 1985.

After quite a bit more searching I was not able to find the original report from 1985. But I have found a number of other papers, book, and reports that cite this study, which leads me to believe its legitimacy.

My interest in these numbers stems from a desire to try to makes roads safer. And the only way to do that is to know what makes them dangerous. If vehicle error is only responsible for 2% of all car crashes, shouldn't we be more focused on other collision factors? We can make a car as safe as possible but if there's still an idiot behind the wheel and there are still monstrous potholes there's still a reasonable chance of an accident. And if human error still plays a part in 93% of all accidents, shouldn't we be focusing on putting better drivers on the road? Perhaps more rigorous license requirements, better driver education and stricter driving laws and punishments would keep bad drivers off the road to reduce the number of collisions and subsequent fatalities. I would love to hear some thoughts on these issues. With the enormous number of automobiles on U.S. roads today and the massive volume of congestion, a numerical/statistical analysis of accidents and their cause may prove to be eye-opening. 

So here are some questions for any redditors with any relevant knowledge: Are these findings still relevant today? Can we still attribute some form of human error or negligence to be wholly or partly responsible for 93% of all collisions? More/less? And what about the other numbers in the chart (such as vehicular error being responsible for a mere 2% of all vehicle collisions), do they mean anything on today's roads or are they outdated. If anyone is familiar with any recent studies on this subject please send them my way!

transportation,congestion,[Idea] High Traffic Variable Speed Limit,"Any time I have to deal with commute traffic on the freeway (which is thankfully rare) I try to figure out what the *actual* rate of movement is instead of the posted maximum.  Posted 65mph doesn't help me and can go to hell when it's bumper to bumper.  The trick is to drive at a consistent speed without needing to put on the brakes, which results in driving slower and coasting at a steady speed (this is normally 20-30mph, depending).  It started off as a game for me after seeing a video from a guy in Seattle trying this, and then got to thinking, ""if everyone else did this we would eliminate stop-and-go traffic"".

In my mind, here's how it would work: The local news is able to report high traffic based on sensors imbedded into the roadways -- with a pair of sensors, set a fixed distance apart, you can determine the rate of travel based off the delay between pings.  We also have reader boards on major freeways that report construction, etc.  Why not link the two?

Calculate an average speed and then post a *recommended* speed (like yellow warning signs for tight corners) that would enable all drivers to move at a constant rate.  This wouldn't change the legal posting, just make it easier on everyone.

This would lower everybody's blood pressure, stress, increase vehicle longevity and make driving a lot safer (but mainly less rage inducing).

I imagine it would take a little bit for people to get use to, but I feel the results would speak for themselves.  All the infrastructure exists, it just needs to be connected.  It makes sense in my head (and I hope I explained it clearly), but would this be feasible?  I can't imagine it costing much since all of the components already exist, but what are some of the hurdles for this kind of idea?

**TL;DR** - Link road sensors with reader boards to post a recommended speed during times of congested traffic.",8,9,2013-09-12 08:28:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Transportation/comments/1m8102/idea_high_traffic_variable_speed_limit/
transportation,congestion,"Why aren't planes ever designed to be overcrowded, even for third world countries with mega demographics?","Metros have the stereotype of being overcrowded in rush hours. And they help reduce road congestion in urban areas.

Why haven't planes ever designed to transport people by the thousands, given that they have payload capacities of about up to 500 tonnes.
If you consider anything beyond sustaining life as a frill, and consider that you could play the percentages and exclude any emergency situations. Think of it as an evacuation, where all that matters is the number of lives that can be revived at the destination.

What kind of plane could possibly transport a mega-stadium worth of people? (Imagine that planes are only used for bulk takeoff and then passengers are dropped off into tethered skydiving mode in aerodynamic envelopes similar to bird flocks) which by giving their own lift, decrease the passenger's apparent weight on the plane, thus potentially doubling overall passengers. Takeoff protocol is also innovated, with disposable fuel boosts (This means that all the fuel used to accelerate the plane to takeoff speed is stored externally) You could use any kind of rocketry if that is more apt for this situation.

roadcam,accident,[USA] - Easily avoidable accident,"(https://youtu.be/EslqwDjudYI?si=xeA2hhwl0klUeamG - 4:19)

Thankfully, not my video. Like the video above, accidents recorded by the cammer often show that a collision was likely avoidable (these videos drive me crazy)! In this case, the offending driver slowly shifts to the leftmost lane. On a normal day, the dash cammer has enough time and reaction to avoid the collision (e.g., slowing down or letting off the gas pedal, some even claim he steered into her car purposefully when he diverted from the yellow lane marking (you have to slow it down to .5 speed to really see it)). After the collision, her car steers across several lanes and regains control, a semi with little room then squeezes by at high speed. The potential collateral damage from the dash cammer‚Äôs inaction could have been catastrophic. 

The question then becomes, at what point does inaction or too slow of a reaction place culpability on the cammer? And had the initial collision caused subsequent ones or even a fatality, what responsibility does the other driver realistically share (last clear chance doctrine).",755,409,2024-12-08 20:50:09,https://v.redd.it/3tmx0a5j6n5e1

roadcam,accident,[Poland] Fatal ambulance accident,"As confirmed by the Radom police, a Peugeot and an ambulance collided at the intersection of DW735 with Warszawska Street. Initial findings at the scene indicate that the driver of the ambulance was driving from Radom towards Warsaw using priority signals. The driver of the Peugeot was driving from Warsaw and was making a left turn correctly at the intersection with traffic lights. Then he hit the ambulance entering the intersection on red light. The ambulance overturned and fell into a roadside ditch.

A total of 8 fire brigades, numbering about 30 firefighters, numerous ambulances and police were sent to the scene. After reaching the place, the rescuers found an ambulance passenger lying on the road, resuscitated by witnesses of the incident and then by firefighters and later by paramedics. Unfortunately, despite the efforts put into first aid, the rescuer of the ambulance involved in this accident died on the spot.

roadcam,delayed,"[Meta][USA] Questions about entering/merging onto an interstate, and about making left turns at a complex intersection","**Disclaimer**: I am new to driving in the USA, so please do not bash me if these questions are very basic. I want to have comprehensive knowledge before I give my drivers test and start driving on US roads.  

I did some searching on the below questions on Google and saw few Youtube tutorials, but recieved conflicting answers to all these questions. I trust you guys, so I came here. Thanks in advance!  


**Merging onto an interstate**  

1. Is it mandatory to merge at the point where the acceleration lane ends? If I find a gap in the interstate's right lane *before* I reach the end of the acceleration lane (and assuming I've reached optimum speed), can I just merge in?  

2. If there is dense traffic on the interstate and I cannot find a gap to merge into, can I slow-down/brake at the end of the acceleration lane and wait for my turn? This makes sense to me rather than trying to budge the traffic on the interstate, since they have the right of way.  

**Turning left at a complex intersection**  
A complex intersection, for the purpose of this post, is an all-way intersection with traffic lights and 2-way left-turn lanes.  

3. While waiting for oncoming through traffic, should you wait at the stop line or in the middle of the intersection?  

4. If you are to wait at the middle of the intersection, is it true that only 1 car can wait at the middle of the intersection, and the cars behind have to stay behind the stop line?  

5. If your light turns green and the oncoming through traffic hasn't started moving, how do you know if you have an advanced green or perhaps the first car in oncoming through traffic is just not paying attention to his green light? In case of doubt, do you turn or wait? If you wait, drivers behind may honk. If you turn and the oncoming through traffic starts to move, you are vulnerable to getting T-boned by oncoming traffic.  

6. If your light turns red while you are still waiting in the middle of the intersection, can you legally pass and complete the turn? Do you have right of way over the other side whose light may have turned green by now?  

7. In case of protected green, do you have the right of way over oncoming traffic that is turning right (assuming you both are equidistant from the turn)? In case of a non protected green, does the same hold true?  

8. In case of advanced green, how do I (as a left-turner) know how much time I have to turn left before oncoming through traffic starts to accelerate? I have noticed they don't always have green left arrows in case of advanced green.   
Example - in case of [this](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7484309,-74.0397788,111m/data=!3m1!1e3) intersection, the side with the dedicated left turn (side with no crosswalk) has an advanced green of 3-4 seconds, but I do not recall seeing a protected left turn arrow or an ""advanced green"" sign. The oncoming side, though, has a ""delayed green"" sign. So if I am turning left from advanced green, I basically continue passing until oncoming light turns green and they start moving. As a left turner, I'd like to know whether I am or am not in that initial 3-4 seconds interval where I have RoW over oncoming traffic.

roadcam,delayed,[USA] Why Zipper Merge Experiment Will Fail in America.,"http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/missouri-kansas-join-states-pushing-zipper-merge-40459016

Zipper Merge:

> *In traffic engineering, the late merge or zipper method is a convention for merging traffic into a reduced number of lanes. Drivers in merging lanes are expected to use both lanes to advance to the lane reduction point and merge at that location, alternating turns.*

Wait, what's that?

> *expected to use both lanes to advance to the lane reduction point and merge at that location, alternating turns.*

Are you kidding me?

> *alternating turns.*

Seriously?  After you factor in all the BMWs and Mercedes me-firsters, The Soccer Mom's in SUVs, Massholes, the I'm important and busy I have a Lexus, and the old white guy in a junker exercising his old white guy in a junker privilege, you have what?  About 5 cars left out of 100 willing to alternate turns. 

Throw in a couple of ricer cars with pop cans for mufflers, and a douchebag on a moto-bike riding a wheelie ""filtering"" down the two mergeing lanes, and all the American Zipper Merge does is push the cluster fuck of merging vehicles right down to the choke point for an even bigger delay.

This will work just as well as other improvements to traffic flow.  Like the Left Lane is the Passing Lane.  Not only a good idea, a rule of the road, but actually codified into law and regulations in 44 out of 50 States.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPOpGafgAyY&index=16&list=PLF9EA292C6FED5B59


Or maybe the solution to ""traffic waves"".  Something first talked about in the 50s, and Disney even made a cartoon about it, (featuring Goofy as the driver) in the 60s.  Here is a solution from 8 years ago:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGFqfTCL2fs

How is that working out for ya?

But yeah, those people that can't even understand you don't cruise in the left hand lane (and driving past sign after sign telling them exactly that)... yeah, those people are suddenly going to start alternating turns when a lane ends.  Because that alternating turn thing is the whole deal that makes the Zipper Merge so much more efficient.

cars,traffic,r/cars is becoming nothing more than blog spam and ads and traffic farming,"I've been a part of this sub for a while now, and I can‚Äôt help but notice that r/cars **is slowly turning into a blog farm**. Instead of having meaningful discussions, DIY tips, project showcases, and enthusiast conversations, it's just **link after link to external articles, blog posts, and clickbait news**.

Sure, I get it ‚Äì some news about the latest models, industry trends, and big recalls are necessary.

cars,traffic,Is it wrong to stop at a traffic light in D? Need to settle this debate with my mom,"My mom got a 2008 Chevrolet Optra earlier this year and it's the same car I learned to drive with, helped by my mom's constant anxiety and scolding. We are both good drivers without many mechanical knowledge, but there's one single problem we both can't seem to agree with and it's gotten really ugly with her going hysteric while I was driving in what was the moment I decided to never drive a car she was in ever again.

My mom has always believed that whenever you stop at a traffic light you have to switch from D to N, I did this at first but then looked it up online and, while there is a general consensus on that being harmful, I still can't find a solid answer for it, I don't want to contradict or argue with her but I do want to clear my mind and settle this once for all. 

When I'm at a traffic light that's gonna take more than 40 seconds I just turn the engine off in P, tho this is not that common in my town since most traffic lights don't have a timer I can rely on for this, so I just press the brake in D until I can keep going.

cars,traffic,Why I sold my Tesla Model 3 Performance & went back to gas,"I owned a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance for roughly two years and 15,000 miles. I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a ""paid big oil shill"" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE.

Everything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today.

And yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there.

# EV performance & its accessibility

I'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the ""pure acceleration"" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.

And how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds. The amount of ""stuff"" involved between your right foot and the tires is a joke compared to an ICE car. And it's basically idiot-proof - even with the Track Mode dialed to 100% hoon in my TM3P, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake. You just put your foot down and the car takes care of the rest, with literally zero drama.

# Electric motors are great

And all of this performance comes with no mechanical sympathy. I never felt an ounce of it, flogging my Model 3 - there's really nothing to ""break"" mechanically in the way of the drivetrain. The entire drive unit consists of the motor, a few gears, the diff, a pump to circulate the oil... and that's really about it. No fried clutches, exploding transmissions, shredded differentials, etc... it's always ready to pounce at any speed, in any situation. Electric motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, quiet, clean, tough, extremely efficient, insanely long-lasting, and have an excellent power/size ratio. When it comes to to the task of turning energy into mechanical force, I'm not sure there's anything better.

AND! You don't even have to worry about getting the motors up to operating temperature before you get on it. During the colder months, it easily takes 10+ minutes of highway driving for the oil of an ICE to warm up (you are looking at your oil and not the coolant temp, right?). I quite enjoyed leaving my neighborhood with the ability to give it full ""throttle"" right out of the gate. It's like teleporting straight into any 3-car gap, no matter where. (But there are limitations to this - more on that later, too.)

# Convenience & running costs

You can also have your cake and eat it, too! There's no need to feel like a moron with a 550 HP ICE engine idling under the hood in daily stop and go traffic. My TM3P was an efficient, calm, quiet, easy, comfortable way of getting from Point A to Point B while being more similar performance-wise to a BMW M3 than a Toyota Corolla - with fewer running costs than either. True, the suspension, brakes, thermal management gubbins, etc., are largely synonymous between an EV and ICE. But when it comes to the actual propulsion, there's basically zero wear and tear. Just a dumb motor that doesn't care about much, and will probably last well past 1 million miles. With a new battery, you're basically looking at a brand-new drivetrain.

And yes, running on electricity is cheaper than filling up an ICE car - this is where most of the EV ""savings"" materialize. In my experience, electricity in the mid-Atlantic region cost roughly 12¬¢/kWh and 9¬¢/kWh in the PNW. For my TM3P, that equates to about $10 and $8 in each region, respectively, to travel \~265 miles, assuming: A 75 kWh battery pack, lifetime consumption average of 280 Wh/mile, and a 13% charging loss, **IF** you can charge at home (which is key to the ""get in and go"" convenience of an EV - without that, forget it). Subtract oil + filter changes, spark plugs, failing chain tensioners, bad oxygen sensors, burnt out cat converters, and other annoying problems, and the running costs quickly stack up in the EV's favor. You rarely even use the brakes! Even with the initial purchase price of an EV still being notably higher than gasoline, on average, you can make the argument that it still comes out cheaper in the long run. But the wildcard here is ""how long is 'long run?'""

The cost of battery pack replacement isn't discussed as often as I'd like. Some of the earliest Model S packs are already starting to fail - only about 10 years later. When I sold my E46, it was approaching 20 years old. It still faithfully serves its new owner on a daily basis, today. Maybe I've only heard about the edge cases, and the Model 3's will all last considerably last longer, but I personally never got comfortable being part of a beta test. The batteries in these cars remain a delicate subject, which brings us to the poo-poo part of this post.

# Let's face it - batteries still suck.

Electric motors are one thing; powering them is an entirely different story. Conventional lithium-ion batteries are really the only currently viable way to power EVs en masse. Part of what makes them great is that they're extremely efficient when it comes to storing and dispensing energy - especially compared to fossil fuels and other solutions in the works. You put electricity in, electricity comes back out. The leap from energy generation to use is extremely short. But they do have notable limitations around longevity, performance, and cost, especially when it comes to shuffling a 2+ ton vehicle around. Whether you're willing to accept these limitations is up to you.

**Degradation is inevitable**

At this point, the oldest Model Ss on the road at about 10 years old. Although the Model 3 pack is newer and has less cells (thus less to go wrong - 7,920 in the Plaid vs 4,416 in a TM3 LR), we don't yet have enough information to truly know what to expect from these packs from a longevity perspective. Unlikely that Tesla will ever share this info, either. If Elon is to be believed, the Model 3 pack should last 300,000 - 500,000 miles. If Elon is to be believed, fully-autonomous cars would've been shuffling us around long before 2020. We know that with proper care, pretty much any modern ICE car should be able to surpass the 250,000 mile mark without many problems. So anyone who likes to run their cars for as long as possible and buys an EV should know that they're venturing into the unknown.

Yes, I'm aware that there are examples out there of Model Ss surpassing several hundred thousand miles - with the caveat being that a not-insignificant number of them of them involved battery and/or drive unit replacements at various points. There are also Hyundai Elantras out there with 1,000,000+ miles on their original powertrains.

But note that degradation is only one part of the story. Upon my departure of Tesland, I can't recall hearing of anyone replacing packs due to natural degradation. All the replacement stories I came across were pack failures in one form or another. Yes, the internet is a fantastic place for angry people to vent, and it could be that the population's negatively skewed - like the Finnish guy who recently blew up his Model S on YouTube. But the reality is that if one single cell - not brick, not module, but **cell** \- fails, the pack is done. That cell turns into a parasite. The car will struggle and ultimately fail to balance out the pack, eventually giving up one morning, telling you to GFY, and to take it to Tesla. Last I heard, replacing the battery on a Model S was \~$24,000 and \~$16,000 for a Model 3. This is just one type of sudden pack failure that I've heard about, and what makes it especially concerning is that the root cause seems fairly trivial relative to the catastrophe that ensues. Maybe it's overblown and maybe I'm being paranoid, but the chances of this happening are real, and only increase in with age...

...which is something else that affects battery degradation, as indicated by Tesla's latest shenanigan of selling ""new"" cars with batteries from 4+ year-old stock, claiming that range ""may be reduced by 12%."" (At the time of this writing: Model 3 SR drive unit + battery warranty is 8 years/100,000 miles, LR is 8 years/120,000 miles). So yes, the car is literally getting worse every day by the sheer virtue of just sitting there - especially in extreme climates. How pronounced is the impact of age vs. use vs. fast-charging is anybody's guess, but it's a reality that needs to be acknowledged.

So if you're comfortable with basically ending up with a 2 - 3 ton paperweight if some electrical fault appears in the pack, and have the means to shovel cash into the Tesla furnace without much concern for what the future may hold, then you're probably less worried about the battery. I envy your fortitude and tolerance for risk - it's something I thought I could swallow, but couldn't. As I learned these realities, I became increasingly less comfortable with the prospect of keeping the car past its warranty period. Yes, an ICE can also fail (a timeworn Tesla fanatic argument), but not many ICE failures end in the car being completely inoperable - especially in modern cars which are ridiculously reliable and serviceable by anyone.

**Mitigation means sacrifice**

If you want the battery to last as long as possible, you have to be nice to it.

You don't want to leave the battery fully-charged for extended periods of time, or let it drop below 10% - there are arguments that doing either of these is more detrimental to battery longevity than supercharging. But this is why the 90 - 100% block on a Tesla's charge indicator is labeled ""Trip."" (I don't think any other manufacturers do this... And part of me wonders whether it's a Teslan strategy to maximize rated range.) So right off the batt (ha), you're 20% down if you're concerned for battery health. It's OK to charge to 100% right before a long trip, but the lower, the better, around town. There are people who charge to 90%, 80%, or even lower on a daily basis as a result. Jeff Dahn recommends 70% to maximize life - you can look him up. Now, paying $50K+ for a vehicle like this and running it below its potential for most of its life just... sucks. Especially seeing as the car produces its maximum power output only at about 90%+ state of charge (SoC).

That's right. Until they develop a battery that behaves like it's filled with a liquid, this is going to remain a reality. Batteries are only at their best when they're charged to 90 - 100% of their capacity. This becomes especially noticeable at highway speeds at a low SoC, since EVs accelerate far more brutally from a stop than from a roll. The car is still **plenty** quick on the highway, but this does result in some ass-clenching moments when passing cars on a divided yellow and you're used to driving around in God Mode. You put your foot down at <30% SoC @ 55 mph, expecting one response, but get quite another. (Disclaimer: Although this is a battery reality, it's also a byproduct of the car having a single gear - no motor can rev to infinity.)

Batteries also do *not* like extreme temperature. Batteries are like people - they're most comfortable at the temperatures we're most comfortable - right around 70¬∞F. This impacts **both** their output and charging. So in the cold, they do not want to charge, and they do not want to give you full power. When it's *extremely* cold, expect to lose 30 - 40% of your range thanks to this convenient little truth, combined with the fact that you're probably running the heat. In lower temperatures, my Model 3's ""acceleration/regen"" indicator frequently told me that the car was both power-limited and/or regen-limited because of a cold-soaked battery. What does ""cold"" mean? I don't know - and seems to change with software updates. Towards the end of my ownership, it seemed that the car sitting overnight in the high 40s/low 50s was enough to result in power limiting to protect the battery. Preheating the car before departure mitigates this problem, which eats into your range unless you're plugged in. (Note that Tesla also recently updated the Model 3 with a heat pump vs. a resistive heater, which sounds like it's notably helped with cold weather driving range. However, initial accounts of how this affects cold weather power output were mixed, as cabin HVAC and battery were both effectively ""competing"" for scavenging what little heat was available. Whether or not these problems have since been remedied, I'm not sure.)

**Performance (with caveats)**

Excessive heat also presents problems. Since an ICE vehicle's engine is operating at about 212¬∞F, the ambient temperature differential is generally more than enough to provide cooling. Even temps of 100¬∞F+ provide plenty of space to act as a sink. But when ""hot"" is closer to \~120¬∞F, as in for a Li-ion battery, things get a bit more challenging. Obviously this won't be a relevant problem for 99.98% of people, but it is an issue if you're planning on sustained high-performance driving. I think the problem is \*almost\* solved through aftermarket components like larger radiators and auxiliary cooling pumps, but as of my leaving the community a number of months ago, it was still an issue for the Model 3, even in cooler temperatures. (Whether they've solved this with the Plaid, I'm not sure - I don't know if anyone's been able to run it for long enough prior to overcooking the horribly insufficient brakes and/or tires.) And if you are planning on tracking your Model 3, anticipate something like <60 miles of track driving range because of an EV's sensitivity to stress, and the simple fact that the car isn't really carrying that much energy on board.

Look up Jason Fenske's Engineering Explained video on battery density on YouTube for an excellent explanation of this. It boils down to the fact that a gallon of gasoline has roughly 13x the energy density than the best of modern Li-ion batteries by volume - and we're strictly talking about the cells here. I.e., it doesn't take into account the fact that there are a lot of other things that need to surround those cells to get them to actually do their job in an EV. The battery pack in a Long Range Model 3 weighs roughly 1,000 lbs... All of the energy contained within equates to roughly 2.2 gallons of gasoline. Which also has the added benefit of being extremely portable, should you find yourself off the beaten path. Try carrying that much energy in batteries by hand... Hope you brought a spare car.

But that's not the entire story. Yes, EVs do put more of that energy into forward motion than an ICE. But this excellent efficiency is also precisely the reason why EV racing isn't going to approach the length of conventional races any time soon. I'm too dumb to explain it in mathematical terms, but since EVs are so efficient, every ""stressor"" they experience has a disproportionate impact on their range vs. a similar ICE vehicle. The best ICE engines on the road today are something like 35 - 40% efficient, which means that 60 - 65% of the energy in the fuel is basically wasted as heat vs. propulsion. So any kind of ""fast"" or aggressive driving is going to have an exponential impact on an EV's range.

I *never* saw the quoted ""310 miles of range"" that's on the sticker of the Model 3 - and this was on the standard, hateful 18"" MXM4s that came with the car. At one point I ran into a former colleague at my local Tesla service center who was there to discuss that very issue - ""I'm not getting 300+ miles on the highway?"" Yep. The girl at the counter told him the same thing. ""That's normal - anything above 70 MPH is going to dramatically decrease your range."" If you look on the forums, generally speaking, the lifetime average consumption that many people are getting hovers around 280 Wh/mile. If you drive like a nance, this number will obviously improve, but if you're on this forum... I'm guessing you drive a bit more spiritedly than that.

To accommodate said spirited driving, I decided to up the car's OEM 235 tires (that's what the new Civic SI comes with, except it's 1,200 lbs lighter) to 265 PS4Ss and installed a set of KW coilovers. As a result of the aforementioned sensitivity, I knew my range would take a hit... but I wasn't quite prepared for how much. One morning while taking my wife to the airport, I said ""ok, I'm just going to drive this like I used to drive the BMW."" Temps were in the upper 40s/lower 50s, heated seats on, cabin heat on low, averaging 70-ish mph on the highway with one passenger + her luggage. On return, I calculated that my range would've come out to roughly **200 miles.** As many Tesla evangelists would argue, ""well, dass enuff range"" and sure, in most situations, that's probably true. But for me, personally, this added another layer of  anxiety that made any form of enthusiastic driving feel like a sin. There are rumors out there that the Model 3 was literally designed around the wheels and tires, and after experiencing that, I'm inclined to believe it.

So when people talk about using EVs to tow over extended distances, I'm not exactly sure how that's gonna fly. Especially with heavy/large loads, and considering that such vehicles will need charging stations spacious enough to accommodate them on long-haul trips. And I don't care about this ""o well X% of people don't tow past Y miles."" I just don't. EV forums are filled with tiresome ""oh you don't need that"" arguments that are somehow supposed to enshroud the fact that for many people, an EV would result in a step backwards when it comes to utility. Anyway, that brings us to everyone's favorite subject - charging infrastructure!

# Do you have a place to charge?

At the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla. And this is assuming you're sticking to generally well-traveled paths in fair-weather conditions. That's because when you buy a Tesla, you're also buying into their supercharger network. The whole experience is generally pretty good - you simply drive up to the charger, plug in your car, and that's it. (Admittedly, I don't have experience with any other EV fast charging, but from what I've heard and seen, it's spotty, at best.)

When you go off the beaten path, that's when things get a little dicey. Every time we went somewhere a little ""unique,"" I'd have to carefully think about what type of range I could expect given the weather conditions and if it was realistic to make a round-trip without buggin'. Expect your ""real"" range in a big-battery Model 3 to be more like \~250 miles on the OEM wheels and tires in good weather. It's true that the car will most likely beat 310 miles in city driving, where EV range is amazing, but that's quite a narrow use case that would take literally all day. Then again, I never actually heard of anyone ""running out of battery"" on the road (in which case your only recourse is to tow the car), but it is a little uncomfortable to read about various close calls, like people trying to keep their families from freezing to death in 10¬∞F weather with the heater sucking down 3 kW, sitting in 3+ hours of traffic. The car does its damndest to keep you from running out, though, triggering warnings to reduce your speed or telling you that you're driving into a ""supercharger desert"" if it calculates that you're living on the edge.

So if you do end up traveling into a supercharger desert, with only third-party and destination chargers to rely on, you have to be prepared to ask yourself several questions:

1. Is there charging?
2. Is it accessible to you? Or is it purely for clients of an establishment, etc.?
3. Is it compatible? Different standards *do* exist, which is genuinely infuriating if we're gonna get serious about electrified personal transport. This isn't a fucking cellphone. As far as I know, third-party fast charging for Teslas is either sketchy at the moment, or nowhere near as powerful as a 150+ kW supercharger. (By the way, melting a J1772 adapter for a Tesla at any third-party chargers is not uncommon. Ask me how I know.)
4. Is it powerful enough to get you the range you need in the time you have to charge?
5. Are you willing to pay the price? A lot of these places are no longer free. Some cost a ridiculous amount for simple Level 2 charging, which is basically like someone asking you to pay for using a dryer outlet.
6. Is it even going to be available? If it's open parking or it's saturated with other EVs, you might have to wait. If it's Level 2, you're probably doomed.

Only if you can answer ""Yes"" to those with confidence are you good-to-go. And while it's true that the ""gas savings"" are real, many people don't seem to be factoring in the charging losses I mentioned earlier. Estimate 10 - 15% losses for charging, meaning that you're consuming more electricity than what actually makes it into the pack. These charging losses get worse in extreme temperatures - up to 40% in cold weather. You still come out ahead, but it's an important fact to note if we're going to be honest with ourselves. And the assumption underpinning that argument is always that you are charging at home - a reality that only exists for something like 40% of the American driving public. Charging at a supercharger costs more.

Even if fast-charging the battery wasn't detrimental to its health, it's not like there's a supercharging station on every corner. Building superchargers costs a lot of money, it's not as simple as just ""tapping into the local supercharger line."" You'll notice that at every station, there's huge enclosed devices turning massive amounts of electricity into DC power. I've heard that Tesla doesn't run these as profit centers, and I do think the pricing to supercharge is very reasonable, but it's still not free (unless you get this incentive) - so charging at a supercharger costs roughly the same in ""fuel"" as driving an econobox.

And as batteries continue getting better and better, as they will, keep in mind that a kWh of energy is a kWh of energy. A theoretical 1 MW pack in a theoretical Tesla semi is going to need a supercharger that outputs about 4x the power of today's fastest superchargers to get to where it's going in any reasonable amount of time. If we imagine some super magic battery that's 50 MW and weighs 1 ton, it's not like you'll be able to charge that on a dryer outlet. You need serious power infrastructure on the other side of that battery to make it practical. I'd imagine that powering sustained commercial flight someday, for example, would basically require airports build their own dedicated power plants. Admittedly I have no clue how difficult or easy this is, but I'm sure there's an army of electrical engineers frothing at the keyboard to add to this point.

# From an enthusiast's perspective...

I've already scratched the surface of this, but I'd like to take a moment to talk about my TM3P strictly from an enthusiast's standpoint. There's a lot of stereotypes out there about Tesla owners, and while it is true that many of them have never seen a flathead screwdriver, there's also a substantial number of them coming from high-performance BMWs, Porsche 911s, Dodge Hellcats, McLarens, etc. A good number of them claim that the TM3P is the ""most fun"" car they've ever owned, and that's great, but I guess fun means different things to different people.

I genuinely feel like two years of driving this car has made me a dumber and less engaged driver. I can't quite put my finger on the root of it - I think it's some combination of no noise, no gears, not using the brakes 98% of the time, and the experience of owning a car that basically does everything for you. For most people, unfortunately, that's probably exactly what they want... but not me. I want to be involved. For most of my life, given the cars I've owned, the journey's always at least been *some* part of the reward. And with the Tesla, I can't say that I ever really ""looked forward"" to driving it. It was  such a seamless and uninvolving experience that it just kind of faded into the background as a simple means to an end, rather than something engaging and fun to look forward to.

And it's not for lack of capability. With coilovers, sways, various control arms, and wheels + tires, my TM3P was razor sharp and scary quick in any given situation. At auto-xs, I was able to hang with seasoned veterans driving Cayman GT4s equipped with track tires. But even then, as I was getting thrown about the cabin on the sofa-like seat (seriously - most comfortable seats of any car I've ever driven), I couldn't help but feel that something was still missing, and it runs deeper than the difference between ""fun"" and ""exciting.""

I don't think it's necessarily down to the fact that I grew up driving with both hands and both feet. A while ago I got a Hyundai Kona AWD as a rental. I had a ton of fun throwing that thing around... maybe more fun than I'd ever had in my Tesla. (As Jeremy Clarkson says - the fastest car in the world is the rental car.) Coming to this tragic realization was a big red flag for me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, at \~4,100 lbs, it's still a a fat-ass car, and the weight was an ever-present part of the experience? Or it starts life as a comfortable family sedan? But then again, so does the M3. I can't for sure pin it down to one thing, but at the end of the day I never really ""felt"" and enjoyed the Tesla in the same way I felt and enjoyed my '99 Miata.

# Tesla and the EV community

This is the part where I rage about Tesla and will probably ruffle some feathers. Too bad.

Let me start off by saying that the service center (SC) employees are generally awesome - at least the one in my local SC. Tesla's engineers are brilliant, too. And it's refreshing to see a novel approach to building a car, where all the systems are so tightly integrated that everything feels ""whole"" vs. a bunch of different fiefdoms colliding into one car at the very end. And they're truly being innovative beyond just the fact that they're making EVs - Elon's woken up to the fact that manufacturing is no joke, and it sounds like they're doing their damnedest to make strides in this area as well. I wouldn't be surprised if ultimately their innovations in manufacturing outweigh their innovations everywhere else.

But I think all of their issues stem from dog-shit, stubborn management, rushing and not thinking things through carefully, an engineering-first approach, and Elon - a guy I can respect, but could use a serious ass-kicking once or twice.

Their quality control is abhorrent - we already know that. Model Ys being delivered with windshields not bonded into place is my favorite recent example. But the materials themselves are nothing to write home about, either. It's not bargain-basement bad, but the Model 3/Y certainly do *not* feel like $45K+ cars, except to clueless new owners who are just getting interested in cars for the first time. This really hit home for me the first time I cleaned my Model 3's interior - the carpets are literally like a glorified version of glovebox liner. The lauded ""vegan leather"" seats don't seem so great, either - look up the headrest bubbling issue on the Model 3. Which is an excellent segue into the mentality of \*some\* Tesla fanatics.

Before we dive into this, let's be clear - The **vast** majority of owners, as usual, are just normal people who don't care. Every car brand has its own subset of narrow-minded insufferable people who will die defending it, no matter what. What makes this subset of Tesla peeps especially unbearable is that they genuinely believe that they are saving the planet and have elevated Tesla to something more of a deity than a car company. So there's this undercurrent of holiness that accompanies the entire sphere and makes the proselytizing that much more infuriating. *""Ew, ICE engines, what a stupid design!""* Yeah. Our civilization got to where it is on AAA batteries!

But that's easy to ignore. The copious amounts of mental gymnastics going on in the community is what's truly saddening. I remember coming across one topic where a guy with a Model X was wondering how he was going to take his family on a ski trip past a supercharger desert in the Northeast. They bought a bunch of 12V heated blankets to avoid running the heat. This is a $100K+ SUV we're talking about.

I came across countless other such examples where fashionable forfeiture serves as justification for buying into a nascent technology - ""Who needs to drive more than 200 miles, anyway?"" False analogies are rampant, also - ""ICE cars overheat too!"" - often in irrelevant comparisons largely due to being an established technology. There was one guy who was worried about using the heat in the wintertime and its impact on range. Someone replied and told him that he wasn't dressing appropriately for the weather.

Back to the vegan leather headrest, otherwise known as ""plastic."" (It's hilarious watching two camps of environmentalists collide - on one end, the bovine enthusiasts. On the other, the guys thinking they're saving the planet in a $100K+ EV carrying around 1,300 lbs+ in batteries.) Something similar started happening to mine, both on driver and passenger sides. Getting it replaced under warranty is hit and miss, because Tesla. According to this vocal minority in the Tesla community, it was, of course, my fault. Not that I'd damaged it intentionally, but that ""some hair products tend to do this"" (hint: I use none) or ""some people's body oils degrade car interiors"" (hint: No car I've ever owned has exhibited this problem, ever. Wife is a completely different race from me, same issue - the fact that I even feel the need mention this is ridiculous). One guy went as far as telling me that the problem was that I was using the headrest as a headrest. OK!

EV blogs like electrek and insideEVs are especially abhorrent. Even as a new owner in my honeymoon phase, I stopped reading those a few months into my ownership. Articles are not written from the perspective of ""is Tesla great?"" but rather ""how great is Tesla, exactly?""

Servicing a Tesla is also an exercise in patience. A number of crucial components like batteries and drive units are ""restricted."" As a DIYer who keeps cars for a long time, this is extremely concerning in the way of Right to Repair. Rich Rebuilds goes on about this. But the company is in no rush to build and support an ecosystem of third-party repair, beyond bullshit like rotating tires. With any other regular car, there's an army of mechanics waiting to serve you should you run into problems.

Finally, the whole ""software as a car"" thing is great - up to a point. It's sort of a double-edged sword. Towards the end of my ownership, my Model 3 started developing this strange intermittent bug that wouldn't let the car go to sleep. So it would inexplicably rip through 1.5% of its battery every hour, just sitting there in the parking lot. No way to tell this was happening. I'd just get into the car the next day and see that the range had gone down considerably overnight. Seeing that issue develop and become increasingly common was very concerning, especially knowing the entropy that can accompany the software lifecycle and Tesla's QC standards. It's one thing to have a bug in your nav, it's quite another when a bug can affect its fundamental operation as A CAR. And with OTA updates, don't assume that just because something works today, it will also work tomorrow. So even though the car is absolutely brilliant in the snow, I never took it skiing, for fear of returning to not only a cold-soaked battery, but also a surprise decrease in available range.

And let's not even get into Full Self-Driving. Anyone who thinks that **truly** self-driving cars are anywhere on this side of 50 years will be sorely disappointed. I genuinely feel for the people plopping down $10K for this feature and hope it's mere pocket change in their world.

And the yoke? lol

# It's up to you.

If the downsides that I've laid out here are within your tolerance limits, and you're willing to bear the risk of being an early adopter, nobody can fault you for going with a BEV if it fits your lifestyle and needs. The Model 3, at the end of the day, is still a fantastic car for regular daily driving, for a lot of people.

Do I think this is the end of EVs for me? No. Maybe for the time being, but I think that in 15 - 20 years, there will be far more well-rounded EVs on the market - battery or otherwise. The potential benefits purely from an ownership/convenience perspective are too great to ignore. And I do think that with their skateboard design, allowing them to ""circumvent"" the pedestrian safety regulations that have absolutely ruined the aesthetics of modern cars, EVs also have the potential to make cars beautiful again.

I went into my Model 3 ownership experience with an open mind, and I genuinely learned a lot and have absolutely zero regrets about my experience. But in the end, I couldn't overlook its shortcomings, as I perceived them, for one simple reason: I just never fell in love with it. For you, things might be different.

cars,traffic,Does anyone elses enjoyment of driving get diminished by having to commute to and from work through heavy traffic everyday?,"When I bought my Celica about a year ago I worked at a local company which I could easily reach by public transport and I didnt have to rely on my car. Back then I had immense fun driving since I could chose when and where to drive on my own terms. Most of my kilometers on the odometer back then were from nightly joyrides on the Autobahn or through curvy backroads with no other cars in sight, just me and my machine.

About two months ago I had to switch jobs and got a new job in a different town about 40 kilometers from where I live which is difficult to reach by public transport, so for the first time I had to rely on my car to get me to and from work every day. To make matters worse there is currently a ton of roadwork on the Autobahn which I have to use every day, which means at least one of three lanes is blocked, so most of my time is spent creeping at 30 kph behind trucks. I need about an hour for those 40 km, which should tell you about the speed I can go at.

This all but has completely killed my enjoyment of driving. Instead of sitting down behind the wheel with a smile on my face as I turn on my car I loathe having to take that commute everyday. Not to mention having to pay super close attention to fuel economy and probably having my rates raise up from increased km/year.

Maybe this is just a whiny rant, but does anyone else feel that way? Right now I feel like I'd rather go back to public transport, even if it would take me longer than being stuck in traffic.

Police, bystanders, and playing cat videos on YT involved in rescue efforts.","The story - 8am Sunday. Leaving GF's place to go to a Cars and Coffee in central CT. As I was pulling out onto a fairly busy road (rt. 44), I saw her running across a perpendicular side street. I put my hazards on, pulled over, and opened the door. She was already running toward the car, so I was hopeful she'd jump right in. No. 

[She ran under the car instead.](https://youtu.be/jldyrfXOB_o)  

I tried to coax her out around towards the passenger side, but [she decided that climbing up the front passenger side control arm was a better idea.](https://imgur.com/a/SFNqC7e)   

It was obvious that it was not going to be a quick stop, so I called local PD, and just kind of tried to keep listening to figure out exactly where she was. She was meowing loudly at least, so her general location was known.  [Trying to use my phone to find her exact location was not working.](https://youtu.be/ECNpYQf8H-k)

[PD shows up](https://i.imgur.com/NrY6Ge1.jpg) and a bunch of bystanders have started to help at this point. She's come down a few times, only to scamper over to the driver's side and climb back up the control arm on that side. One of the guys helping out, almost reached her tail, but she jumped into the barrel of the wheel, and ran to the back of the car. Up the control arm again, and now she's really up there. We can barely hear her. 

After about 45 minutes, the cop is like ""Well, there's nothing else we can do. Maybe just park it and she'll come out eventually.""  It's starting to get busy and it's a terrible place to be pulled over, so I get it.  I tell him my GF's place is right around the corner and ask if he can follow me. I planned on limping there, as the thought of a kitten falling into a part of a running drive train isn't pleasant, obviously. There's also a pretty hot exhaust, falling out into the road, etc etc. 

I limp the car back and can hear her the whole way, which was good. I pulled into and open spot and the cop took off. It was better now at least, as it was safe from traffic and on flat ground. At this point, she got quiet. She was super small, so I knew she couldn't really ninja cat away without me seeing, like a full sized cat could. I figured she went to sleep, because cat. I was about to just leave the car, call a buddy and head to C&C, hoping she would get bored and come out eventually. I didn't want to jack the car up, as lowering it back down could crush her, and there's not a lot to reach under there anyway. Again, I didn't want her squeezing up into an even tighter spot where she couldn't get her self out. 


There was literally nothing I thought I could do. A few people were out walking their dogs, and I explained what happened. I figured maybe someone had some treats or something. I know nothing about cats. 

One very nice woman, who was walking a handsome hound-type dog named Duke, had a good idea: maybe she would respond to sounds of another cat. I looked up ""mother cat calling kittens"" on YoutTube, and played [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l81-68Cwr0c) on my phone for like 20 minutes.  

She actually came down out of the car...lol. So she's under there, out of reach, looking at the phone, then back at me like ""I see what you're trying to do, asshole."" But, as often happens, curiosity got the better of the kitten. I moved the phone out further away from the car and backed off, myself. By this time, the woman, had returned from bringing Duke back inside, and saw the little kitten cautiously approaching the phone. I figured the best play would be to get behind her, so if she made a break for it, she'd go away from the car and not back under it. Sure enough, she made a move towards some bushes and we had her surrounded. The woman was able to finally get a hold of her and she calmed down pretty quickly.


[Package secured](https://i.imgur.com/D2Aw6aL.jpg)

The woman took her inside, fed her and gave her water. She then took the kitten to the vet.  According to the vet, she's about 6 weeks old and healthy. The woman is a cat owner/animal lover, and is adopting her. So, in the end, it all ended well.  Oh, and I made it to Cars and Coffee. 



TL;DR Stray kitten crossed traffic to hide under and in my car for over an hour. Played cat videos to lure her out. She's fine, adopted by a wonderful person and I made it to Cars and Coffee.

There's a video of the incident that shows how the 911 was flagged and how the system works in general. [Link here](https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a60583398/nyc-noise-camera-loud-exhaust-case/)

> Even with a stock exhaust, you and your performance car of choice could have the privilege of paying the City of New York $800 for a noise violation. Thanks to a new noise violation pilot program aimed at curbing loud exhausts and excessive honking with smart cameras and microphones, the potential for punitive punishment is on the rise for enthusiasts across all five boroughs.

> Certainly, there is a decibel limit to the pops and crackles that even us enthusiasts can endure, and the tolerance of the general public often falls far below that line. Particularly in the wake of the pandemic, the prevalence of gun-shot-like backfires has turned public perception sour on modified cars, leading local officials in both New York and California to take action on such quality-of-life issues.

> Specifically, New York City approved a pilot program of noise-monitoring cameras in December 2023, arming each borough with at least five of the newly developed cameras.

> The program is young, but it has the potential to be a major pain even for drivers of unmodified cars.

> Operated jointly by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Transportation, the conjoined camera and microphone operate much like speed or red light cameras, snapping pictures of the offender's license plate and issuing a fine to the registered owner. Unlike speed light cameras, however, the locations of the noise-monitoring cameras have not been initially disclosed to the general public.

> Fitted with sensitive microphones, the $35,000 cameras detect and capture everything from loud exhausts and backfires to honking and blasting music. Eighty-five decibels is the threshold for receiving a fine, which starts at $800 for a first offense and rises to $2,500 for repeat offenders. For reference, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention places the average environmental noise level of city traffic inside a car at 85 decibels, indicating that City officials are targeting those who go above and beyond a normative sound level.

> ""We‚Äôre going after those who are potentially using an illegal vehicle, a modified vehicle, some that are really acting loudly,"" NYC Council Majority Leader Keith Powers said in a statement last year. ""Even in the city that doesn‚Äôt sleep, New Yorkers deserve some peace and quiet.""

> Officials like Powers assured everyday drivers that the program isn't about penalizing unmodified vehicles or the occasional honk. In practice, however, that promise hasn't exactly panned out for people like Jerry H (who wished to keep their last name anonymous), who received an $800 noise violation ticket in his bone stock 2010 Porsche 911 Carrera S.

> Traversing across the east end of Manhattan's 36th Street and funneling into the blue-and-yellow tiled Queens-Midtown Tunnel, Jerry was commuting home to the outer reaches of Queens. Making the light-to-light slog that is Manhattan traffic, Jerry accelerated to the penultimate light before hitting the tunnel, focused on getting home. Weeks later, he received a notice in the mail that he had been caught violating the Stop Spreading the Noise Act.

> With a 3.8-liter flat-six, a stock exhaust, and on a relatively slow section of road, Jerry was initially puzzled by the violation. Sure, he admits to hitting 35 mph in a 25 mph zone, but he wasn't speeding excessively or wringing out the rear-mounted engine, either. With $800 on the line and a car that he thought would be exempt from such fines, Jerry built a defense and filed an appeal with the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.

> Armed with an independent decibel test, certified documents proving the 997 was stock, and questions about the calibration of the cameras, Jerry appealed the violation and lost not once but twice. Up against lawyers for the Department of Environmental Protection, he queried them about the once-a-year calibration of the camera, the sonic combination of rear-engine induction and exhaust noise, and even the gearing in his car.

> On the other side of the virtual bar, lawyers for the City mounted a defense with video footage not previously provided to the owner of the 911. The footage, analyzed by Road & Track, shows a 997-generation 911 accelerating up to a light and a series of red dots marking sound waves exceeding 85 decibels. The dots lock onto the car as well as the street, scaffolding, and buildings beside it. According to the documents provided by the DEP, the 997's signature flat-six rose to 90.4 decibels at its loudest.

> In the judge's eyes, that was evidence enough to uphold the violation against Jerry in both appeals, regardless of the stock exhaust fitted to the car. This sets a precedent much like a California case involving a stock Hyundai Elantra N, in that owners can be heavily penalized for simply buying and owning a factory vehicle. No matter the age or factory status of the vehicle, New York City's pilot program can and will get you for being too loud.

> ""It just makes no sense to not have exemptions,"" Jerry said in an interview with Road & Track. ""And it's pretty clear that automakers don't want to get involved with this. They want nothing to do with this.""

> Jerry is not alone in this frustration, either. Prior to the official approval of the pilot program in 2023, the DEP has been running a small noise camera test program since 2021, issuing as many as 218 noise violations for allegedly modified mufflers last year. Additionally, court documents cite another case of a stock car, a 2018 Jaguar F-Type, receiving and being held to the $800 violation fine for making 86 decibels of noise earlier this year. That's one decibel over the limit.

> California's current noise enforcement standards are actually looser than NYC's, with a standard of 95 decibels for cars and 80 for motorcycles built after 1985. Similarly, California's enforcement standards don't charge first-time offenders and even offer payment waivers for those not able to pay the fine or adequately repair their car. No such exemptions or caveats exist in the text of the NYC Council bill. Globally, Berlin, Paris, and the United Kingdom have also trialed such decibel monitoring devices, and other U.S. cities are considering it, too.

> ""The NYC Noise Code has a strict standard of 76 dB(A). DEP enforces if the vehicle creates noise of more than 85 dB(A) at 50 feet,"" a spokesperson for the DEP said in a statement to Road & Track. ""Stock vehicles that emit excessive levels of noise result from actions taken by the driver. That is why the standard of law is no person shall cause or permit the exceedance of the decibel standard.""

> While the precedent set by Jerry's experience is a worrying one for car enthusiasts, motorcyclists, and anyone ready to test the limits of their sound system this summer, it's worth noting that noise pollution is indeed a major problem in New York City, too. Research from 2014 estimated that around 90 percent of New York City residents are exposed to levels of noise exceeding the Environmental Protection Agency's noise limit guidelines. The results of this aren't catastrophic in the short term but can develop into cognitive issues over time.

> Specifically, research shows that prolonged sleep disruption, hearing loss, hypertension, and heart disease are all linked to consistent noise pollution. Additionally, the impacts of noise are specifically detrimental to children, yielding decreased memory, struggling reading skills, and lower test scores when consistently exposed to high levels of noise. With noise monitored by New York City‚Äôs Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as well as 311 noise complaint data, the top sonic offenders in NYC are unsurprisingly traffic, sirens, and construction.

Road&Track seems to be focusing on the fact the 911 was stock. But that doesn't matter. It's a noise law. If the car exceeds 85 dB it's breaking the law regardless of whether the exhaust is stock or not. And it's a very reasonable law. Auto makers are ultimately at fault for stock cars that break noise regulations, but every time a sports car that's not loud gets released every sports car enthusiast complains that it's not loud enough. Well this is the other side of that coin.",715,549,2024-05-08 19:46:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1cn5n7z/even_stock_exhausts_arent_safe_from_nyc_noise/

My wife and I were looking to replace her 2016 Nissan Sentra with an SUV as she wanted more space for our frequent road trips from San Antonio to Louisiana. Since her vehicle would be the long distance one, we were looking into PHEVs that way I could get a BEV in 5 years when it‚Äôs time to replace my car, and hopefully in 10 years when it‚Äôs time to replace her car, we would go full BEV when the technology caught up. I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u9hhxo/has_anyone_had_recent_success_getting_a_new_phev/) asking about MSRP dealers for PHEVs and got inundated with comments saying to just buy a BEV. After hours arguing with people about it, [u/weldae](https://www.reddit.com/u/weldae/) left [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u9hhxo/comment/i5rxmpa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) comment that caught my attention as it seemed to indicate the Ioniq 5 would make the trip faster than a Tesla Model 3. That didn‚Äôt seem right to me, so I looked it up and saw the car for the first time. It was more than what we wanted to spend, but holy cow was it gorgeous. My wife, who always said it‚Äôs stupid to care about what your car looks like since you‚Äôll be sitting inside it, immediately declared that she wanted it without knowing anything about it. After a week of researching, comparing it to the EV6 and other EVs, we went ahead and bought an SE RWD. To be clear, if there was a PHEV version of the I5, we would have gotten that instead. But regardless, after over a month and over 3,000 miles, here are 10 things to consider before buying a BEV for road trips.

#1. My actual road trip range is less than half of the listed 300 miles

The EPA estimated range of the Ioniq 5 RWD is 303 miles, but this drops significantly on the highway. Driving around 80mph, my efficiency is around 2.4mi/kWh ([u/Willman3755](https://www.reddit.com/u/Willman3755/) did a fantastic [roll-down test](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u8enlo/i_did_rolldown_testing_on_the_ioniq_5_to_create/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) with an Ioniq 5 AWD and my real-world experience in my RWD has matched his results extremely closely. His post and my experience also show that no, it's not faster overall to just drive slower for better range) On a 77.4kWh battery, that‚Äôs only around 186 miles. And that‚Äôs from 100% to 0. On a road trip, you‚Äôre typically limited to using about 70% of your battery (the 10-80%) as your charging speed drops significantly past 80%. So that 186 miles is really about 130 miles between stops. And that‚Äôs assuming there‚Äôs a charger at that distance. My route has chargers spaced roughly 60 miles apart. Despite the 300 mile listed range, my car can‚Äôt really make it to a charger 180 miles away, so I‚Äôm stuck stopping every 120 miles or so. At 80 mph, that‚Äôs a stop every hour and a half. Keep in mind, this is in the south, where temperatures have been warm, so I‚Äôm not losing any range for the cold. Just a bit for the A/C.

It‚Äôs about 480 miles from Baton Rouge, LA to our house in San Antonio, TX and we make this drive pretty frequently. A person brand new to BEVs might look at the I5‚Äôs 300 mile range and expect to be able to make the trip with just one stop about the halfway point. But this is what my most recent trip was actually like.

55 miles to first stop in Lafayette to charge from 14%-74% (there are no DCFCs in BR so we started with about 40% SoC): 19 minutes total (16 minutes charging, plus 3 minutes to switch chargers as the first was only giving 100kw.

120 miles to 2nd stop in Vidor to charge from 7%-66% (Every stop this trip, the speed dropped to 30kw after adding about 59% to the battery): 14 minutes total

12 miles to 3rd stop for Fuzzy‚Äôs Tacos: 3 minutes total

75 miles to 4th stop in Houston to charge from 13%-72%: Total time 16 minutes

40 miles to 5th stop in Katy to charge from 54%-83% (This was the last known working EA station on our route home, so we needed to stop here in case the one in Columbus was out): 14 minutes as we only got 100kw speeds

45 miles to 6th stop in Columbus to charge from 58%-81%: Total time 20 minutes. Only two stations of the 4 were working, so we wasted time trying the two broken ones, and a Kona was using the 350kw, so we were stuck with 150kw. Mainly happy that it worked at all.

140 miles to home and arrived with 3% battery after dropping speeds for the last 70 miles.

A trip that normally takes about 6.5 hours including gas, food, and restroom stops took us about 8 hours despite the good charging speeds. And that still beat the ABRP estimate. Keep in mind the charging stop times do not include time to actually get to the chargers which are further off the road than typical gas stations.

#2. Highway efficiency is as important as range and charging speeds for road trips. Knowing your car‚Äôs miles/minute charge rate is more important than its kw rate.

Let‚Äôs say you routinely take 1200 mile road trips and you‚Äôre looking at two BEVs.

Car A: 200 mile highway range using 70% of the battery. Average charging speed 200kw. 70% battery capacity 125kWH

Car B: 150 mile highway range (at 70%). Avg charging speed 150kw. 70% battery capacity 50kWH.

On the surface, Car A looks like the clear winner. Longer range, faster charging speed, bigger battery. But Car B has the significant advantage of highway efficiency, getting 3mi/kWh vs Car A‚Äôs 1.6mi/kWh. This means that Car A only charges at a rate of 5.33 miles/min while Car B charges at 7.5 miles/min. Car A would need to stop 5 times to charge for 37.5 minutes each for a total of 187.5 minutes while Car B would need to stop 7 times to charge for 20 minutes each for a total of 140 minutes. Even if we add 10 minutes extra for each stop, Car B would make the trip faster by about half an hour. Make sure to verify your car‚Äôs highway efficiency numbers when looking for a road trip BEV.

A car like the 2020 Ioniq isn‚Äôt seen as a great road tripper due to the 170 mile range and 50kw charging speed. But with a tested highway efficiency of 4.5mi/kWh, its highway range doesn‚Äôt fall off a cliff like many cars and it has the added bonus of being able to maintain its miles/minute charge rate using any DCFC 50kw and up. You can regain about 120 miles of range in 30 minutes. The upcoming Silverado EV claims 400 mile range with a 200kWh battery. If its highway efficiency is actually 1.5mi/kWh (very possible considering the enormous battery size), then it‚Äôs actual highway range at 70% would be 210 miles. If you get stuck on a 150kw charger (see number 7), and you‚Äôre only charging at a rate of 160kw, it would take you about 30 minutes to recoup 120 miles of range, about the same as the Ioniq. That‚Äôs not to say that the Ioniq is as good of a road tripper as the Silverado, but the real-world difference might not be as much as you think. Especially considering the Ioniq‚Äôs mile/min charge rate would be triple the Silverado‚Äôs if they‚Äôre both at a 50kw.

#3. EV charge stations are pretty terrible compared to gas stations

Most aren‚Äôt covered, so you get soaked in the rain and baked in the sun. They aren‚Äôt pull-through like gas stations so it‚Äôs often pretty awkward getting your car oriented to charge. Not only do I have to back in (which is not that simple with some Walmart parking lots being one-ways with the parking spots meant to be driven in forward), I have to hope that the charger is on my passenger side for the stations that aren‚Äôt right behind you. For [my first ever charge](https://imgur.com/a/OJluUg1) I had to park in a spot that wasn‚Äôt even technically for EVs just to get the charger to reach. Or just [look at how this car had to park](https://imgur.com/a/AujnY7s) to access this station. Now imagine if there were other cars parked in the other stations already. Since the cables are often pretty short, you‚Äôre basically out of luck. I have no idea how people with trailers are supposed to charge at most of these stations. Plus, I‚Äôve never needed a Shell or Exxon app to refuel my car, but I now have to have apps for all of the different charge stations that I use. I‚Äôve seen several new owners on the phone with others trying to get help with getting the station to work. And that‚Äôs not even mentioning how often a station is randomly down or has slow speeds with no warning. Additionally, I feel significantly less safe at EV stations than at gas stations. If I pull up to a gas station at night and there‚Äôs sketchy characters around, I can just drive to another nearby. If I pull up to a EV station in the dark corner of a Walmart parking lot at night, I don‚Äôt have much choice but to plug in and hope for the best. Not only am I stuck there for significantly longer than a gas station, I also don‚Äôt have the option of just driving away if someone is approaching who looks like they have bad intentions. If the car is plugged in, it literally cannot start. And there is no Ejecto Chargo button to try and get away. You‚Äôre a sitting duck. And since EVs are still pretty expensive, this may become an obvious target for people looking to make an easy score. Unlike most gas stations which tend to be open 24 hours, most Walmarts are closed overnights, so that 2am charge becomes even less comfortable.

#4. Road tripping an EV can be more expensive than gas

This greatly depends on your car and where you‚Äôre road tripping, but in general, DC fast charging isn‚Äôt much cheaper than gas. Electrify America charges $0.43/kWh. At 2.4mi/kWh, it costs about $0.18 per mile to road trip an Ioniq 5. My Ford Fusion Hybrid gets 40mpg at 80mph. Gas prices in my area are around $4.40, meaning the Fusion costs about $0.11 per mile. The Ioniq 5 is about 60% more expensive. There‚Äôs a $4 a month subscription to bring the price down a bit, but I‚Äôd need to drive about 1000 miles a year to break even, and then after the discount I‚Äôm still paying $0.13 per mile. Obviously, this depends heavily on several factors, including the car‚Äôs efficiency, gas prices in the area, charging prices in the area (Texas and Louisiana charge by the minute, so the Ioniq 5 is actually significantly cheaper on my route), and any possibly incentives like the free charging for 2 years that we got with the purchase. But it‚Äôs an important consideration when calculating the cost savings of an EV. If you‚Äôre comparing a BEV with a hybrid or PHEV, your gas savings may not be as much as you expect if a significant portion of your miles come from road trips.

#5. Even if charging an EV was as fast as filling a gas car, many EV road trips would still take longer

There are DCFCs along most major interstates, but the fastest routes aren‚Äôt always along those interstates. For example, when visiting Baton Rouge from San Antonio, we typically stop off in Opelousas to visit some family. It is significantly faster to take 190 after Lake Charles and then stay on 190 into Baton Rouge. Instead, we now have to go out of our way to Lafayette to charge before going to Opelousas, and then back to Lafayette after leaving Opelousas to charge again because Baton Rouge does not have a single DCFC. This problem is exacerbated when travelling from Dallas to Opelousas as the fastest route through Shreveport is impossible with the current charging infrastructure. This means we have to take a route 2 hours slower just to not be stranded. Combine this with the previous detour and we‚Äôre easily adding 5 hours to a round trip without even factoring in charging time. I know a lot of people in this sub think the real road trip isn‚Äôt the destination but is actually the Walmarts you meet along the way, but for frequent, repetitive road trips that don‚Äôt have good scenery, this is a lot of extra time in the car.

When comparing travel times, always make sure to put in a round trip to ABRP with the start and end destination at your house and a waypoint at your actual destination. This ensures that you‚Äôre factoring in time to charge for the way home as well. Also make sure to check the travel time vs Google Maps. A round trip from San Antonio to Denver is around 27 hours in Google Maps, but 34 hours with ABRP. Only 3.5 of the 7 hour difference is charge time. The other 3.5 hours is due to the slow driving needed just to make it to the chargers. You need more than just time spent charging to calculate the true time loss of road tripping a BEV.

#6. There are some places that you may not be able to go

Charging infrastructure is improving, but there‚Äôs still a long way to go. My wife was considering taking our niece to South Padre Island, so she plugged in a round trip from San Antonio into ABRP. No valid routes. We looked at Plugshare and confirmed that it simply wasn‚Äôt realistic to try and make it there and back in her car without putting ourselves in some sketchy situations. In your area this may be a non-issue, but there are still many rural places that an EV can‚Äôt get you just yet.

#7. Assume you‚Äôll be charging at 150kw, even if your car can take more. You‚Äôre more likely to be ‚ÄúICEd‚Äù by an EV.

Every EA station on my route has 4-6 stations with only a maximum of 2 being 350kw. And you can almost guarantee that if people are there, they‚Äôre going to be using the 350s. I‚Äôve already had many instances of being stuck on 150kw charger become some Bolt or ID.4 was taking the 350kw charger for no apparent reason. I‚Äôve seen a Polestar roll up to a site with 5 empty stations and still plug in to the one with a Chademo because forget Leaf owners I guess. And I‚Äôve already seen multiple instances of L2 chargers being blocked by Teslas that aren‚Äôt even plugged in. There‚Äôs a good chance that if a charger you need is being blocked, it will be another EV doing it. With gas, if someone is blocking a station, you just pull into one of the other 16 at that gas station, or just go to another if they‚Äôre all full. Personally, I would like to see an additional fee get added to 350kw stations. Maybe $0.05 per minute. That way cars that can‚Äôt benefit from the extra speed of the 350s have an incentive not to use them.

#8. Be prepared for the possibility of long lines at charging stations during an upcoming holiday season

Obviously nobody can predict the future, but as many in this sub point out, EV adoption is picking up extremely quickly. Currently there are only 3 CCS DCFC sites with 150kw units in the entire state of Louisiana. EA currently doesn‚Äôt show any plans to add additional chargers in Louisiana on I-10, so those 3 sites will need to serve all of the traffic passing through Louisiana for the foreseeable future. 2 of the 3 sites only have 4 stations. Let‚Äôs assume the average car takes 30 minutes to charge (some are faster, but some are slower and since it may be cold during Christmas, 30 minutes is actually being generous). This means a site with 4 stations can only charge 8 cars per hour. With the increased non-Tesla EV sales, the reduced range and increased charge times during the winter, and the increase in traffic during the holiday seasons, it‚Äôs entirely possible that sites could face a bottleneck where the rate of cars needing to charge surpasses the capacity of the site. Especially considering these sites have to serve traffic travelling in both directions and you can‚Äôt exactly just go to another if the site is full. If over a 10 hour period, a 4 station site gets 10 cars per hour, you‚Äôre looking at a 2.5 hour backlog. I‚Äôm already seeing photos spread around this sub of full charging stations. Will this be an issue this year? Maybe not. But it could pose serious problems in 2023 or even 2024. Many MV electrical distribution equipment have 18-24 month lead times, so if adding more sites to a route isn‚Äôt already in EA‚Äôs plan, there‚Äôs a good chance it won‚Äôt happen until 2025 at the earliest. I‚Äôm an electrical engineer currently working on a project that involves installing [battery electric locomotives](https://www.up.com/media/releases/battery-electric-locomotive-nr-220128.htm) for a rail company and we‚Äôre targeting an end of 2024 completion date partially due to long equipment lead times. If the utility needs to make substation improvements, it could be even longer. EA may have deals in place that allow them to acquire the necessary equipment more quickly, but if adding more sites in a particular area isn‚Äôt already in the works, I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see it happen for quite awhile.

#9. Your car‚Äôs needs now have to be factored into your plans

I‚Äôm sure there were a few people who read the paragraph about needing 6 stops and wondered why I didn‚Äôt just get food during one of the stops or pick out a hotel that had EV charging so we didn‚Äôt have to leave at 40% SoC. The simple answer is that we have already established hotels and food places that we like for this trip. Many EV owners just take it as a given that they‚Äôre going to choose whatever hotel in the area has charging or that they can just eat whatever is close while the car is charging. But I don‚Äôt want my car‚Äôs needs dictating where I stay or what I eat. It already dictates where I stop. In all my years of travelling this stretch I would never voluntarily stop in Vidor, TX for example, but the car doesn‚Äôt give you many options. Not a huge deal, but something to consider.

#10. Extra passengers impact range and efficiency

I realize initial reactions to this may be ‚Äúwell duh‚Äù but impacting range and efficiency is a bigger deal in an EV than a gas car. I can drive about 540 miles on a tank in my Fusion Hybrid, so losing 10% for adding a passenger doesn‚Äôt change much. I‚Äôm still stopping for gas only once during the 480 mile trip. We averaged 2.4mi/kWh on our recent trip to Baton Rouge, but only 2.1mi/kWh on the trip back despite driving around the same speeds. Certainly, the wind or battery temperature could have had an impact, but I believe the major difference was that we added my niece as well as her luggage. When looking at range and 70mph tests, keep in mind they‚Äôre usually done with one driver and no luggage. If you‚Äôre road tripping with a family and a bunch of gear, you may see some significant drop-offs in efficiency. I don‚Äôt know the exact effects, but I would love to see some studies on it.

#Bonus for Ioniq 5 shoppers: AWD and RWD get essentially the same range

You may have figured this out after number 1, but there is essentially no difference between the road trip range of a RWD and AWD I5 despite the 50 mile gap in the EPA range. My real-world experience has lined up with previous AWD tests including the InsideEvs and Out of Spec 70mph range tests. An AWD that‚Äôs driving in Eco is only using RWD, so you get almost the same range. The only difference is the slight weight difference of the front motor which is the rough equivalent of having an extra passenger. The large difference in the EPA range is due to the testing using Normal mode which utilizes AWD. So if you want an AWD, don‚Äôt worry about the range difference as long as you drive in Eco on the highway. You can still enjoy the benefits of AWD in the city.

#Would I still buy this car if I could do it over?

Honestly, I absolute would. It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm still simply infatuated with the Ioniq 5 and my opinion will change in time. But as of now, I‚Äôd still much rather do an 8 hour road trip in the I5 than a 6.5 hour trip in an ICE. The quiet, comfortable, roomy ride, plus the instant torque and the ability to silently pass people before they can speed up to block you make it worth the extra time for me. I pointed out the frequent stops before, but it really helps to break up the drive so you‚Äôre not sitting in a car for hours and hours on end. Instead of one long trip, it feels more like 5 short trips. No sore butt, no back pain, no avoiding drinking so you don‚Äôt have to use the restroom. Yes, I could switch back to a gas car and just start taking breaks, but it‚Äôs a huge mental hurdle as it then feels like I‚Äôm wasting time when I could be driving. With the EV, you‚Äôre not fighting the urge to just keep pushing to get it over with. Speeding along from charger to charger is honestly fun and I have no idea when that‚Äôs going to stop being the case. Not to mention the I5 has regen paddles that let you control the regen levels, which make driving much more fun. If I‚Äôm going 100 and I see traffic ahead going 70, I can take my foot off the gas to start coasting down to the 90s. If I‚Äôm still too fast I go to Level 1 regen, still too fast and I click again to go to Level 2. It‚Äôs a constant game of how far can I go while not having to touch the gas or brake pedal. It‚Äôs honestly pretty difficult to go back to driving my Fusion after driving the I5, but the current plan is still to keep it for another 5 years‚Ä¶unless I stumble across a good deal for a 2017 Ioniq Electric. The point of the post isn‚Äôt to discourage anyone from getting an EV, but just to provide some additional perspective that a lot of BEVangelicals in this sub often leave out.

Edit: I also forgot to add that the Ioniq 5 estimates your range based on past driving. So if an inexperienced person has been driving around the city and getting great efficiency, the guess-o-meter will easily show over 300 miles. When that person sets out for a road trip they may have no idea that their actual range is closer to 200.

cars,accident,"Today, the 14th notable accident in 12 years occurred in my yard. Always be mindful of these morons. They are ostensibly everywhere.","When I picked the location to build my house, I thought it was a great spot. An 8.5-acre erstwhile cow pasture on as large creek, still within reasonqble commuting distance to Atlanta. 

I made one terrible mistake: I built my home  on a long straightaway opening out of a  deceptively steep curve. I  grew up in subdivisions. This problem never even entered my mind.

My property is situated perfectly for speeders who careen off the road ,af the apex of the curve to come barrel-rolling through my yard in dramatic fashion. 

When I say 14 notable accidents, I mean accidents where a car had to be towed or pulled out. That doesn't include the 3 times people have run over my mailbox. 

 5 of the crashes resulted in significant injuries meaning broken things and ambulance rides. 
 
Two of them were fatalities. One was a drunk guyy in a van with no seatbelt on. The other was a kid on a Ducati that centered a telephone pole running 70 mph.  That time the 911 operator hung up on me, actually. I told her it was a fatal crash, and about the 5th time she asked me if the victim was responsive I said ""Which fucking piece of him would you like me to ask, you, you stupid piece of shir?""

Stress. But seriously, always by mindful of other drivers.. a lot of them are bumbling morons.

cars,accident,"My car has been in 14 accidents from many fender benders to 3 major wrecks. It has been hit by an 18-wheeler and in a major wreck on the freeway. Last night, it was put to rest as it performed its last service for me and saved my brother's life.","Hi all-

I just really wanted to post this because it is so incredible to me and I want this experience shared. It is a true testament to what amazing manufacturing can provide (or maybe just luck, I don't know, I'm not that kind of engineer).

My car was a 2007 Honda CR-V.  It had 120,000 miles on it, and I have owned it for nearly 12 years (bought brand new for my 15th birthday).  

I have the worst luck with cars.  THE WORST LUCK WITH CARS.   I have been in the car for more than 20 wrecks.  obviously the majority being fender benders.  I have been in the car with 5 different boyfriends over the course of my life when each totaled their cars.  I have only been at fault for 1 wreck (its not like I weaseled my way out or something they have all been cut and dry) I have been rear ended 6 times sitting still at a red light.  I legitimately have friends who wont let me in the car because they are convinced I am bad luck.     

This car has never so much as made a strange sound.  I have never in my life had an issue.  I have had to change the tires obviously, replace brake pads, etc.  but nothing has ever broken on it. Every piece of technology, AC, everything has worked perfectly through the entire life of the car.  

I realize this is not unusual, but 3 of the wrecks I have had with it have been major.  The axel has snapped and the side crushed in when I was T-Boned by an 18-Wheeler (It was not going too fast).  I was in a 4 car pile up on the freeway 2 days after I turned 16 when a truck bed liner flew out of a truck going 65 mph.  The marks on the median are still there from my car to this day, every other car was totaled but mine.  

Seriously, this car was so reliable.  I had my 100K mile tune up and the dealership said ""this car runs beautifully, I have no suggestions beyond the usual tune-up""   

Now to the story of what happened yesterday. My brother and I traded cars for the summer.  He was going to be driving 1500 miles to an internship in his pick-up so I offered to trade with him.  He would get better gas mileage and my Fiance and I just bought our first house so having a pick-up would help us a lot with projects.  

So yesterday morning, he called me upset.  He was driving around 45 mph through a green light and someone coming the other direction in an Explorer didn't yield to take a left and he t-boned them going full speed.  All of the airbags deployed and the car was destroyed.  The other person had moderate injuries from the glass, and had some really bad head and neck pain from the whip.   The other car was slammed into the traffic light pole.   

My brother didn't have a scratch on him, and not a single pane of glass shattered.  in fact- I have never had a single pane of glass shatter in any wreck I have been in that car.  

Here are the pics of the car: https://i.imgur.com/qfz0Dvj.jpg . 
I am fully convinced that this car is a miracle.  look how crushed the front and side are, and the drivers area is untouched. 

I was so shaken up for what could have been.  But really my heart is full because this has been an amazing experience with a car.   My brothers first sentence to me after was, ""I am buying this car for all of my children when they turn 16""

So thats my love song to the car I received as a present when I turned 15. 

I can't wait to buy my next one this weekend. :)

Edit:  **I am going to count the wrecks up I have been in the car for from my memory so I can be more clear.**  20 was an estimate. 

1.  My mom slid into a guard rail on ice
2.  One my mom was merged into and side swiped
3.  My mom's car was slightly hit when the car in front of us tried to pass someone and hit someone else head-on going the other way (that was very serious and someone nearly died, luckily my mom was a cop and knew what to do.  She pulled the unconscious person out of their car and did something, I was really little I dont remember)
4. My other brother had been mudding in his jeep and it was raining and he rear ended someone when they hit the brakes.  He was a fucking moron for that, but that will help him to remember what mudding does to your tires.    I was in the car and 15. 
5.  Freeway pile up I mentioned when I was 16.  A trunk bed liner flew out of a truck and 4 cars were involved by either being hit by it or swerving to miss it.  I swerved to miss it, the car behind me hit me from behind because she followed me and slammed me into the median, both of our cars went slightly sideways momentarily on the median and came back down.  Hers was bad.  She almost got hit getting out of the car because of her panic.  Luckily my mom was a cop and always said that people die getting out of their cars on the freeway after a wreck, so I grabbed her and pulled her aside, we were very lucky. 
6.  My friend backed my CRV into a brick wall while moving it in HS.
7.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
8.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
9.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
10.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
11.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
12.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
13.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
14.  HS boyfriend was rear ended and totaled his car. 
15. BF #2 went fast over traintracks with me and ripped something under his car that meant it was leaking oil, he didnt notice so it destroyed the engine, totaling the car. 
16.  BF #3 backed into a car in the parking lot, they were both backing up and not looking.   His car was not totaled actually now that I think about it, so I was dramatic when I said it was all totaled.
17. BF #4 was rear ended in the rain.  Cheap car so it was totaled
18. BF #5 was also rear ended in the rain.  Cheap car so it was totaled.
19.  I was in a parking lot looking for a spot and an old man driving an 18-wheeler accidentally went pedal to the metal and t-boned me, major damage to my car. 
20.  I was in another parking lot also looking for a spot and I backed up and looked right and left and missed a car turning the corner and I hit him, totally my fault.  
21. Someone backed into my car when they went too far into an intersection and panicked.  I didn't have time to move, but honked too late.  No real damage to the cars. 
22. I was in another parking lot and some young kid wanted a spot and flipped it in reverse and backed into me, I was behind him, but didn't react fast enough which drove me to take defensive driving courses. 
23. My friend was driving my car and went off the road on a big turn and the bottom of my car slid on the street.  It did something to the underside of the car.  That wasn't bad but the damage was expensive, so I counted that as major. 
24. Someone ran a red light by accident and hit their brakes just in time to very very slightly t-bone me going through the green light.  
25.  We were on a 4-lane street and I said ""Hey lets stop at Mac's"" and my moron friend said ""Okay"" and merged without looking to make the turn for Macs in like milliseconds.  she hit a taxi.  We aren't friends anymore because she told me I should pay for the ticket because I said we should go to Mac's...

So the ACTUAL totals are:
14 wrecks in my car
25 wrecks total
I was the driver for 12 of them. 
1 I was at fault for 
3 were major

Edit 2:  Hey guys, I really appreciate all of the replies.  I am just going to blanket answer a bunch of these questions as my inbox is sort of blowing up with repeats.  

1.  I understand ""at fault"" doesnt mean I am not partially responsible, of course I could have reacted better in a few of these, but I have taken 2 defensive driving courses since these happened and genuinely try my best to be safe. I never want to hurt anyone.  a lot of these are skewed towards my first few years of driving.  I will always claim responsibility if it is mine to claim.  I have never tried to get money out of people or purposely caused wrecks.  I have never done a random break slam that caused any of these.

2.  If I am a passenger, and I didn't impede the drivers ability to drive or their attention, that wreck was not my fault.  Full stop.  

3.  Most of these were very very small and classifying them as wrecks may be confusing you. I counted any time my car or a car I was a passenger in hit or was hit by something it should not have been causing the 2 drivers to get out of their cars together and discuss damage even if it was only a dent and scratch.   
Most of y'all know that any amount of damage, however small, can cause problems in a car and the only point of including those is that it was a reliable car and didn't have that happen. 

4.  If your only contribution is to call me a shit driver or tell me I should never drive again, feel free to just upvote the other folks who have already done so. I cant just not drive anymore, sorry its necessary to get to my job.  If you sincerely believe I am somehow a danger to you, please feel free to leave tips I am always down for bettering myself.

cars,accident,I've suddenly lost interest in buying convertibles after my friends accident,"For the longest amount of time, my dream was to own a convertible, a Porsche Boxster. I don't drive fast, always in the middle lane (3 lanes) and like to cruise and take my time to get to where I want to. I've also been racing in karting for some amount of time, leaving speed for the track.

But recently a friend of mine got into an accident. He didn't make it. He was too young. Suddenly my outlook changed for small cars (although he didn't have one), and thought a lot more about safety. I'm even doubting about racing again, maybe just some laps on track would do rather than competing again.

I've suddenly had this switch from convertibles and small cars to compact SUVs, for safety reasons. Am I crazy or is me being spooked out really legitimate.

I totally forgot about it until this morning on my rainy commute. I hit the patch and lost traction on the left front and rear tires and my car started to pull toward the median. However then I remembered all the rainy races I had done in Forza 6, and how they have patches just like this. I remembered it's best to slightly let off the throttle and hold the wheel, not to brake or countersteer, and I did that. Within a few seconds I was back to normal and I avoided what could have been a nasty, even fatal accident!

> **Car has been in the shop for 3 months, and Tesla still hasn't delivered the parts.** Tesla is the bottleneck here, which is really frustrating since the shop could complete repairs within a week or two if they just got the parts. I haven't even been able to experience 8.0. 

> https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/54yz9s/still_waiting/

> Some updates for anyone interested. Body shop started taking car apart, found more damage, now has to order even more parts from Tesla. Tesla says those parts are backordered and gave no indication as to when the shop can expect to receive them. The shop had also previously said that even after they get all the parts, it will take 6-8 weeks to actually conduct the repairs.

> **I took delivery of the car in January 2016, and it was hit 6 months later in July 2016. Even if the shop got all the parts today (which they won't obviously), 8 weeks from now puts me into January 2017. So realistically, I'm looking at February to March 2017 before I get my car back, meaning it will have spent 6-8 months in the shop, after I only had it for 6 months. Again, I do blame Tesla for this since they're the bottleneck with getting parts.**

> Before I left Tesla, I asked Jon McNeil personally to try helping as a personal favor, and he did what he could but ultimately Tesla can't get the parts in a timely fashion still. This whole situation has us pretty livid, as we're still paying large monthly payments for the car to sit in the shop waiting for Tesla to deliver parts.

> This has some pretty serious implications for Model 3 if this problem persists. If Tesla can in fact scale to hundreds of thousands of 3s (a big IF), how does it hope to cope with commensurately increasing need for parts since people inevitably get in accidents?

cars,accident,The tesla V11 Update is Starting to Make me Regret my Model 3 Purchase,"I've owned my 2022 M3LR for about a month, I've put 1600 miles on it around the PNW and overall it's been a good ownership experience. Things work (more on that), the seats are comfy, heater is awesome, fast charging is incredible, low maintenance, ride is smooth and quiet.

I am coming to this car from a 2014 Porsche Cayman S. I did months of research, I even rented a 2020 M3LR FSD in LA. I cross shopped between a Porsche Macan GTS and Volvo V60 T8 Polestar. I ultimately decided the Tesla was for me, I have wanted a Model S since I saw one back in 2014 so it felt natural. I also liked some of the maintenance  advantages of an EV. I jumped into the deep end and installed a wall charger myself.

Delivery and everything was great, the buying experience couldn't have been more flawless. The car has some QC issues, which I expected. But the first thing that felt off was that the passenger lumbar was missing, my wife has a bad back and actually uses the cars lumbar support, support informed me they removed it ""because no one used it"". On the drive back on the interstate we experienced some mild ""phantom braking"" during our first time using autopilot. No big deal it was rainy and wet. Come Christmas, we load up and head to my parents house in North Central Washington. We are driving on two lane highway and we experience harsh phantom braking, like standing on the brakes hard, even in regular cruise control the car will panic and slam on the brakes. This is absolutely a safety hazard to the public and should not be available in cars if it isn't tested properly. Even in perfect dry conditions the car brakes so hard it could cause an accident for no reason. We started using auto pilot and cruise control only on interstates but with my foot over the accelerator to override the stupid ""emergency braking"" feature. The rental we had did not have this issue, and I believe it is because of the radar cruise control instead of cameras. 

I noticed with the 2021 models tesla removed a ""chill"" mode for regen braking. On perfect dry/wet roads regen is great. When you have a foot of snow and a steep grade, regen is my worst nightmare. AWD is great but it won't save your ass on ice. Just an option to coast or dial down the regen a bit would be great. It is insanely difficult to balance braking and accelerating while also avoiding other cars in extreme winter conditions. I want to strap a tesla engineer into their car and challenge them to drive down a iced over hill.

Next is this UI update, the previous UI was gorgeous and perfect, seat heaters, defrost, profiles, car info, and dashcam were all a single button press away. I bought the car because tesla was known for having the best UI in the business. Now for zero good reason everything is buried in a menu. Seat heater? Menu. Tire pressure? Menu. Glovebox? Yes. Dash cam? Pick your favorite tool bar app. This new ui update causes more time looking off the road and more time fiddling with a touch screen. At least the Porsche was flooded with physical buttons. The new UI is the last straw for me, it added a whole level of distraction and causes more issues than it solves and is unacceptable in a $55k car, I can't imagine how plaid owners feel.

I know that things will be updated and fixed in the future, but for how long? How long do I have to wait to have a car that doesn't feel like a prototype? How long before I can trust my car on a highway? How long before someone is killed in a rear end accident due to ""phantom braking""?But hey, we got a light show, sonic the hedgehog, and tik tok. 

I am planning to make a complaint to NHTSA about the braking issue and find some sort of email I can send my complaints to with tesla. Their after purchase support is near nonexistent.

TLDR: The car is great and has so much potential to be incredible. However, there are some extreme safety and design issues with the car that need to be addressed immediately, the car feels like a half baked prototype. Tesla needs to spend more time making their software safe and easy to use over novelties and gimmicks.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the discussion and input. I mostly needed to vent and bring teslas behavior to light (not that it hasn't already). Hopefully this will inform people considering a Tesla and prevent them from making thr same mistake. I am planning to look at a CPO Porsche Macan GTS this weekend and hopefully have tesla buy back the car or sell it.",3516,993,2022-01-05 21:09:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rwpnpf/the_tesla_v11_update_is_starting_to_make_me/

So, two days after I made that thread, I got a message from a redditor with an email address that simply said ""Email me, I might be able to help you out.""

So I did. And he was not lying.

The redditor  in question does not wish to be identified, but he is an engineer who works for the Georgia Department of Transportation. Within 48 hours of contacting him, there were DOT inspectors looking at the curve. 

They have already put up a temporary sign, and our anonymous engineer friend has told me he is about 95% sure they will get a green light to re-engineerr the curve so it is banked properly as well as  build up the shoulder to keep cars from rolling. 

I am absolutely thrilled at the way this has transpired. I think my exasperation came through in the previous thread. I couldn't get to the right person, so the right person reached our to me.

If everything goes well, in a  few months I will make a final thread showing the changes they've made. What's more, Mr. Engineer  has told me he will provide me with some technical material to share on here about what they will be doing, so we can see the process by which roads are engineered.

cars,accident,Teenagers should not be allowed to drive high performance cars on a standard drivers license,"I live in LA and there was recently a story I‚Äôm sure some of you have heard of about a teenager driving a Lamborghini Urus getting in an accident and killing a woman.

cars,accident,Police cars are getting out of hand with their stupid fucking lights,"I'm getting pretty pissed at the police cars these days with the collective illumination power of a few midsize death stars. I came around an exit the other night, it was pouring with rain, and what do I see at the apex of this blind corner, but a pair of cop cars with more lights on than you could find at a fucking skrillex show. Each with the power to ignite a piece of steel from a mile away. Of course they could have moved, oh I don't know, 20 feet down the road into an empty parking lot, but they decided this was where they needed to meet up to ruin someone's life. I nearly went off the road. I just couldn't fucking see a thing. I could have easily hit one of them. I was directing the steering wheel with what could barely be described as a guess. 

I get it. It's for ""safety."" But back in the day, if a cop wanted to pull someone over, he put a solo cup on his roof with a jack-o-lantern candle inside, and if he wanted extra illumination, he had a little spotlight on the side of his car. That seemed to do the trick just fine. Now, this ""safety"" bullshit means that everyone has to very nearly have an accident just because someone was reckless enough to go 10 over. Good job. You've made the streets that much safer. 

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! It's not just the collapsed sun on the roof, they've got more lights, they've got a bakers dozen hidden in the bumper, the brake lights turn into mini raves, the high beams flash, and the new versions of those light bars can turn into regular white led light bars ten times brighter than a bikini atoll fireworks show.

And it seems they love to fine any excuse to use them. Parked on the side of the road? Fuck it, turn them on. Pulled someone over? Sure, let's turn the flashers on the back and wander around in the street. And let's turn the light bar on as well and see if we can't send oncoming traffic drifting into a tree. Work zone? Yeah, what people trying to avoid hitting workers really need is to lose their vision at 60 mph.

cars,accident,Hyundai is a shit company that does not honor Warranties- or even their settlement agreement,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short and simple. Over this last summer, my Hyundai Tucson completely shut off when I was driving on the highway. Thank God I did not get hurt or in any accidents I maintain my car regularly, change the oil every 5 or 6 months, and always got to a Hyundai dealership for maintenance for the past several years, so I didn‚Äôt understand what the hell happened 

Turns out, Hyundai Tucson from the year I bought it are known for having defective engines, and my car suffered ‚Äúcatastrophic engine failure‚Äù at no fault of my own. 

Well guess what, I had to take out a loaner car for over two months since they couldn‚Äôt get the parts in a reasonable time because of all the worldwide shipping issues. 
The worst part is, Hyundai refuses to fully reimburse me for the out-of pocket cost I had to incur for renting a car! They are only offering me a 50% ( edit: just checked emails: not even a 50% offer- they are offering only less than 40%)refund on this expense, even though (1) my ten year warranty says any damage that is not caused by me will be FULLY covered by Hyundai and (2) a recent class action settlement with Hyundai says that they must reimburse people who‚Äôve suffered these damages ‚Äúthe full reasonable cost of car rental‚Äù. 

I would advise anyone to avoid Hyundai like the plague. I can‚Äôt believe I actually recommended this company to people. The customer service is shit and they are giving me the run around. I‚Äôm sick and tired of these crappy companies not abiding by the damn warranty or settlement agreement!

cars,accident,What I learned after getting my car totaled,"In January I was going 45 miles an hour, straight through a green light, when an 82 year old in a brand new Yukon Denali turned left directly into my path. It‚Äôs too easy to get a license in this country (USA) and too easy to keep a license once you have it ‚Äì especially for old people. Anyway ‚Äì I stood on the brakes but it was no use. I turned right to avoid T-Boning him and our cars came together on my front left and his front right. I knew as soon as we hit my car was totaled. His airbag went off ‚Äì mine didn‚Äôt. I wonder if that‚Äôs payback for keeping an ironic ‚ÄúTakata‚Äù keychain on my car keys all these years. And yes ‚Äì I had all my recalls done. Luckily, I‚Äôm fine. I was sore for a few days but no lingering injuries or pain of any kind. So I‚Äôve come here today to share with you all what I‚Äôve learned. 

1. Get a dash cam ‚Äì and not a cheap one. After the accident I thought I‚Äôd pull the footage from my dash cam. Unfortunately for me ‚Äì it stopped recording months ago and never notified me. It was a Scosche Dashcam with sandisk SD card, hardwired into the car. It was a 90 dollar camera. My next camera will likely be one of the dual channel blackvue models that can be controlled and accessed from a phone. I ran a dashcam after being wrongfully blamed in an accident at age 17. I was attempting to turn left on a wide, unpainted road when a woman tried to pass me on the inside and rear ended me. The insurance company (progressive) ruled that it was a two lane street and for me to have been rear ended ‚Äúshe would have had to have been driving in the median.‚Äù They had pictures of the damage to my car, so I‚Äôm not sure how they came to this conclusion. Me, being an idiot 17 year old, didn‚Äôt know I could contest this ruling ‚Äì send additional photos of the road and videos of the normal flow of traffic on it, or even sue the insurer. I just accepted defeat and moved on. Oh well. Point is ‚Äì get a nice dash cam and make sure it works. 

2. Document. Everything. I had put thousands of dollars into my Outback. CB radio, trailer hitch with towing wiring, tint, vinyl black on the hood to cut glare, hardline dash cam, bull bar, off road lights, weather tech floor matts and rain guards ‚Äì on that note the weather tech rain guards actually suck, don‚Äôt buy them. Winter tires and steelies, a full size spare, wilco offroad spare carrier with an OEM wheel, I could go on. Point is ‚Äì keep receipts for all of this stuff and be ready to present it to insurance because it impacts the valuation of your car. And if you have the presence of mind ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt, being somewhat disoriented from the accident and emotionally distraught about the car ‚Äì take pictures of the other car too. Get their VIN and plate number and obviously insurance info. It‚Äôll speed up the process. 

3. Follow up and be your own advocate. The other guys insurance company was Nationwide and I could not be less impressed with them. Progressive ‚Äì before Nationwide accepted liability ‚Äì and Nationwide BOTH tried to pressure me into releasing the car or having it towed from the shop because they didn‚Äôt want to pay any storage fees. Nationwide took this to another level by threatening to stop paying for storage fees before they had given me a settlement ‚Äì the same girl telling me they would stop payment for storage also couldn‚Äôt even tell me what the car had been appraised for. Like no, dipshit, you‚Äôre not touching my car until you at least tell me what you‚Äôve determined it‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôm not letting you take the car to God knows where and then tell me ‚Äúlol it‚Äôs worth 800 dollars sucks to suck,‚Äù after the fact. If you can afford to insure a blind 82 year old who can‚Äôt see someone coming straight at him through a green light you can afford my storage fee. I looked at comparable models with comparable mileage on autotrader within 100 miles of my zip and I know what a fair adjustment is (in this case, approximately 8K with the manual which I had). I had to speak to several different reps before finally getting in touch with someone who could answer my question ‚Äì on the literal day they were to stop paying for the storage fees. I placed an average of five calls every day over the course of four days because they simply would not answer my calls or return my messages. Cannot stress enough what a horribly unresponsive, garbage experience Nationwide made this out to be ‚Äì I‚Äôll never use them. Take notes on everyone you speak to, when you speak to them, and key bullet points of what they said. Do not let the insurance company make you dance in circles so they can rip you off down the road. (can you tell I don‚Äôt like insurance companies?)

4. Losing a car you love is devastating. I had put thousands of work into this outback in just the few months prior to having it taken from me. It had a brand new clutch, new catalytic converter and a whole new ignition system. I had intended to drive it until the rust gods reclaimed it or the engine exploded ‚Äì they stopped making manual Outbacks in 2014 so I knew I could never replace what I had in this car. It was the first car I bought for myself, my first manual, my first AWD. I drove that car across the country more than once and I piled countless miles on it trudging through deep snow in the mountains of upstate New York. The memories and automotive learning experiences I had in that vehicle will be with me forever ‚Äì but I‚Äôm not ashamed to say I shed a tear leaving her at the accident site that night. I loved that car. I‚Äôll never be totally over it. 

Final thoughts :: The cars initial appraisal was just shy of 8K. I asked what about modifications and accessories? They said send receipts. I asked what about maintenance? They said they‚Äôll factor in a percentage of non-wear items, so while things like oil changes won‚Äôt count, recent mechanical replacements will effect it. Modifications and accessories brought me over 9K and maintenance records brought it over 10k. We bought a 2023 VW Atlas SE w/Technology, VR6 4Motion. I‚Äôll write a review after we‚Äôve had it for a year.

cars,roadblock,Beginner project car advice thread. New to engine swaps or project cars and have a question? Ask away!,"Some general advice:

Try to find a community that specializes in the vehicle on which you are basing your project. This could be on reddit, Facebook, old school forums, etc. It could even be meeting up in person at shows. Talking to people who have done this before can be a massive savings in time and money.

Search. If you have a specific idea in mind, odds are that someone else has tried some variation of it. People in specialized forums get response fatigue from noobs who haven‚Äôt even bothered to read an FAQ or search the archives. You‚Äôre far more likely to get a detailed response when you indicate you‚Äôve already done some homework. Folks over at the excellent /r/projectcar subreddit suggest including car, engine, plans, build so far, budget, etc.

cars,roadblock,Has anyone else here noticed all the cool old vintage cars being used in the cover thumbnails and illustrations by Creepypasta / horror narrators?,"I'm starting to see this more and more. Well known YouTube narrators like Mr Creeps, Lighthouse Horror, Operation Insomnia, Lets Read, and others have all included cool old vintage vehicles in their cover / screen illustrations rather than generic late-model vehicles. Whether that was for mood, effect, or setting a time period I don't know. 

Here are some prime examples:

1. This story compilation from Let's Read, shows a sheriff exiting a 1950s styled patrol unit which looks like an old Plymouth :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RrdEhn9QSY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RrdEhn9QSY) 
2.   The cover art of Creepypasta narrator Lighthouse Horror's stories features many of these, including a G-body wagon, a 67-68 Mustang, 80's vintage square body Ford Crown Vic police cruisers, and an early 90's Saturn sedan. 
3. In this Mr. Creeps story, it shows a bunch of humanoid snow creatures attacking a late second-generation VW camper bus:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo09NjB1rFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo09NjB1rFI)
4. A 3-hour story compilation by Mr.Creeps shows two late 1950s / early 1960s Mopar patrol units from different agencies as its cover art.
5. Yet another story by Mr. Creeps, with the cover art showing a late 90's B-body Chevy Caprice or Impala encountering a ghostly roadblock: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlAOLpFINmM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlAOLpFINmM)

cars,roadblock,Please Help: Compustar ???,"I'd like to install a high-end Compustar alarm/remote start system on my 2008 Toyota Land Cruiser. They are insanely expensive to have installed professionally (around $1,000+ depending on options), but after lots of research it seems it can be done DIY for much, much cheaper. I just want to make sure I properly understand the install process and equipment needed:

1. Acquire desired Firstech DC3 bypass/alarm/remote start as the main brain/controller and bypass module. ($106 on Amazon)
2. Use software to flash/program DC3 module for correct vehicle (free on Firstech's website)
3. Ideally use a wiring harness to avoid complexity and save time (not sure they make one for my vehicle...not a big deal, I'm good with wiring).
4. Install antenna to receive signal from compatible remote(s). (ANT-2WDSS for $90 on Fleabay)
5. Program compatible remote (Compustar T13 for $140 on Fleabay)
6. Install any extra security alarm stuff one might want...window break sensor, sirens, etc. (Compustar Alarm It Kit $60)

If this is correct, I could have a $1,000+ system for under $400....which would be very nice. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something or going to run into problems with some proprietary roadblock or special programming that I will be unable to access as a lowly DIY'er. I've read the manual for the DC3. It's helpful, but doesn't address this specifically, and this topic is sufficiently complex that I feel like I may be missing something.

cars,roadblock,I need some help with a birthday present for my younger sister,"Dear /r/cars,

My name is Colin and my younger sister is turning 18 in about a month. She LOVES cars (Audi's in particular) and I myself know very little about cars. I wanna get her something special for her 18th birthday. Do any of you have any car related ideas?

Something around 100 euro's would be ideal but I'm willing to stretch to a max of 300 euro's if it's a really cool idea.

I'll tell you a bit about her in case it might help with any idea's.

Like I said before my sister LOVES cars, she is currently studying to become a truck driver and car mechanic. Her dream job is to drive around F1 cars (as a truck driver) and work on them (as a mechanic). She just started her study but already encountered some roadblocks. I fully support her of course and wanna give her as much motivation as possible to get trough it all. 

We have a pretty rough household, divorced parents, shitty relatives, an asshole dad that never cared about us, lots for bad boyfriends and some bad friends. She has been battling trough it all and now things have been better then ever before. She has an amazing boyfriend and they really care for each other (he is also the first bf I didn't wanna punch in the face immediately when I first saw him). And things have gotten better at home but are still shitty from time to time.

I really really wanna turn her 18th birthday in to something special, she deserves it. And I'm willing to go a long way to make it special.

Thanks in advance for reading my post.

cars,roadblock,"Lets talk roads and road trips. Just returned from a ~2200 mile (round trip) road trip. Story, thoughts, rants, etc inside as well (long post)","We all love cars (obviously), but we never really talk about the other important part of being a car guy... roads, and road trips.

If youve never driven the western US, i highly recommend it, especially the backroads of mid Washington.

A friend had been bothering to come see them in BFE washington since they moved out there a few months ago. Ive recently quit my job, and figured while i was without a major daily burden, now would be the best time to do so. Couldnt have been more right, in almost every aspect. Ive got a 2.5 year old pit, who i could never leave behind for a weekend. Just wasnt happening. As a result, i decided to drive instead of fly so i could take him, and he could enjoy the sights and smells as well.

Unfortunately, i wish i couldve taken my mustang, but im not sure it wouldve survived the mountains. And im sure my dog wouldve been mad as fuck. I took my xterra, which, while i love, is a bit like driving a shaved brick when doing 65+. Before we left, i did a tuneup, filters plugs and all. Better safe than sorry. I also packed up some tools; sockets and ratchets, prybar, bottlejack, screwdrivers, adjustable wrench, and a pair of pliers. I trust my cars and my work, but i dont trust them THAT much.

As we hit the road we hit the typical LA traffic, but it felt different, maybe because i was leaving? Idk. Once we passed LA, the freeway opened up and finally got to at least get over 60 before we hit a number of uphill mountain sections. As we approached one, there was a sign ""Dont overheat, turn off A/C"".

It used to be common knowledge, but i guess its not anymore; When ascending a huge hill such as the 405 or 5 across SFV, especially on a warm or hot day, i was always taught to keep the engine from overheating to crank the heat up and then roll the windows down for personal temperature control. 

As i flew up it i kicked the heater on full blast and dropped the windows, i managed to keep a consistent 60-65 (at the loud protest of my brick going up that steep of a hill at that speed), still,  the temp gauge sink down. Toward the top were a number of cars and trucks scattering the shoulder. Even a few newer cars too, which is what blew my mind.

Once we were finally out of real civilization, i realized i had forgotten how big CA really is. Its easy to forget that theres more to CA than Los Angeles, and something i really didnt realize is the amount of farmland and more or less empty space there is through the middle of it. It kinda shocked me how id forgotten such a thing.

Fast forward a few hundred miles of insect holocaust and roads as flat as kansas. Somewhere around Sacramento it started to rain, not a downpour, but enough to suck when you want to have the windows down.

Being in LA traffic all the time has really slowed down how fast i drive. Before i got out here i was consistently doing 5-7 over all the time. I found myself having to focus to actually go over the speed limit at all. Im keeping up with traffic, but not able to pass most other cars.

After a rest somewhere around Redding, i hit the road again. It was probably 9p by then. I headed out, not knowing that ahead of me was 4 hours of mountain driving. Quite literally exactly at the OR/CA border was a wall of fog.. or cloud... im not sure which.. we were up high enough that we may have been in a cloud. Everyone ahead of me slowed down to almost a halt, and was crawling along. Yet i kept on going; just with hazards on and at a slow speed. Lost everyone for a number of miles.

Along the way i discovered some city/street/river names that got a good chuckle out of me, couldve been the lack of sleep, but i thought they were good.

 * City: Yolo; has signs saying ""starting call boxes"", apparently you never go full yolo, so keep emergency lines open.

 * Street: Easy St, leads up a mountain. Easy street aint easy.

 * City: Weed; heh.

 * River: Skookumchuck River, and dam. /r/skookum. 

 * City: Yoncalla; ""yoncalla?"", 'nope, im not gonna'

It also dawned on me that a lot of states have the same names of streets and even a few cities.. why is that?

As we got out of the fog/cloud, a car came up behind me, and stayed close for a few miles, he passed me, which i was happy for because my headlights were not doin the trick with wet unlit roads and rain. He got ahead by about 1/3 mile before he slowed down a bit, causing me to pass him. We played vehicular leapfrog through the mountains of oregon for the duration of going through the passes there.

The stresses of the road finally got to me, along with being on the road for almost 13 hours; i pulled off somewhere in oregon to get gas, some food, and sleep, probably like midnight or so. Totally forgot that you cant pump your own gas there.. and thought the guy asking me what gas i was getting was gonna do some weird shit. Especially given ive already seen the weirdness of orgeon at its finest, i slept in the car instead of getting a room. I slept in the front seats, and actually found a really comfortable position. Open center console and lay a blanket or pillow over the opening, feet out in the passenger seat or in the foot well, driver seat tilted as far back as it will go. When i woke up, it was early morning, and i saw there was a ""cafe/restaurant"" in the parking lot.

How the shit do truckers and travelers eat this shit? Id rather have gotten breakfast from mcdonalds. I ordered a muffin, bowl of fruit, and some sausage links to split with my dog. The muffin was meh, greasy though. The fruit looked like it had either been sitting since the last time someone asked for fruit, or it was out of a can, from 3 years ago. I went to split the sausage with my dog, and there was more grease than sausage. Terrible. Turrrrrrrible.

It turned out i was only about an hour from portland, and ive now only got about 300 miles to my destination, and thankfully that also means a clean bathroom, something that actually resembles food, and a bed.

I was really happy that my body said stop when it did. I got to see portland and WA in the daylight. Portland's transportation setup is very interesting, a bit confusing, but nothing gps and/or time cant fix. The roadways and views overlooking the water was cool to see. Out of portland in into washington. Again, glad i was seeing it in the day time, the scenery was amazing. Everything is so green, but muddy...

After sleeping for a few hours once i got to the hotel, my friend met up with me and took me to a bar near their place, which is right up against a forest. Since i didnt know the roads i stayed slow, but every moment of it made me wish i couldve brought my mustang.

I spent most of saturday and sunday, driving around the town i was in, or some of the backroads leading to parks and such. Small towns always have weird road setups, and this was no different. Spotty gps got me lost at least 5 times, but it was a good lost.. accidentally put myself down some amazing country roads. Sure it took longer, but.. driving!!! So many people out there have an amazing gem of a car just rotting away outside. If i had the money, space, and towing capacity, there were at least two i really wanted to try and talk into selling. 

One im not even sure what it was, and wish id taken a picture of or even stopped for more than a second. It kinda looked like a late 50s early 60s thunderbird, but wasnt, with 4 doors. Looked fantastic even if it wouldve been a rustbucket. Sitting in a driveway with grass growing around it.

Monday morning, time for me to go. The drive back to some resemblance of civilization, and the highway was a 20 mile country road. Even given i was leaving, it was still a fun drive.

Back on the highway, being out in the countryside got me to open the throttle more than before, and had started driving like before i was in LA. I also i realized that almost all other drivers (truckers excluded, 99.9% of the time) are absolutely terrible at following two very specific signs, and it made me want to yell like no other.

 * Slower traffic keep right

 * Keep right except to pass

How goddamn hard is it to follow these? Stay the hell over unless youre about to pass someone. I cant count how many times myself and others ended up in a slowdown for more than 2 miles because of some idiot in the right lane keeping up with the semis instead of passing them. Or worse, a semi who wont let another pass, and so end up creating a roadblock for 2 miles until one of them changes their attitude.

The drive up to the mountains of oregon was pretty uneventful, except for the cop who decided to search my vehicle for drugs over my front license plate being off. He conned me out of the car saying he couldnt hear me, then made a stink about 'being cool' and 'im just doin my job' and that i should let him search because he was being nice. I let him search because i knew they were really gonna fuck with me if i didnt. Of course they found nothing, wasted half an hour of all of our time because my front plate wont stay put.

Off again i set. Seeing the highway through the mountains in the day time made me realize the number of turns and complexity, and that i passed some amazing scenery along the way.

I initially was going to stop in redding, or sacramento to rest, but was so anxious to get back to my own bed... and i knew if i slept id wake up and have to drive back home in LA traffic.. f that noise. I drove straight on home

I breached LA city limits at about 1am, but.. it looked different, felt different. I got back to the 405, and even as i passed areas i knew and got into familiar territory again, everything looked different. The freeway id drive every day seemed to look different. Even the roads by my house seem different. Its weird.

I finally got in at about 3am, tired as hell. Even now after sleeping i feel like im recovering from a hangover. 17 hours on the road in more or less a single day is hard on the body.

cars,roadblock,Insurance Advice,"Hey /r/cars,

I'm 23 years old and looking to purchase a fun car and am running into a bit of a roadblock.

I have 2 minor accidents ($1k combined payout) on my record and its driving up my insurance costs to absurd levels. Both people refused to let me pay to fix the damage and insisted on going through my insurance.

Right now I have a 2006 Ford Fusion and I'm paying $1600 per 6 months. I shopped around quite a bit and it was the cheapest I could find for 100k/300k coverage. I needed full coverage since I was financing the car.

I'm looking to buy a used 2 sweater sports car like a c6 Corvette, 370z, S2000, but the insurance quotes I'm getting are over $2100 for 6 months. Is there something I'm overlooking? Is this normal for someone in my situation? Is there maybe a smaller insurance company I should look into that might be cheaper?

I really don't want to have to give up on driving what I want due to insurance, but I'm not seeing any way around it.",1,15,2013-04-18 01:38:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1ck0b8/insurance_advice/

cars,delayed,I'm getting rid of my 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range after 6 months of ownership. Here's why:,"I decided to lease a Tesla Model 3 Long Range (through my company) in June of 2021. After 6 months, I've decided that I absolutely hate the car. Here's why:

* Autopilot isn't nearly as good as I expected. It works well under one condition: you are on the freeway on a clearly marked lane with no lanes splitting or merging into your lane. The Tesla has SLAMMED on the brakes while going 70MPH on the freeway because the carpool lane split into two lanes and the Tesla didn't know how to navigate it. Also it will brake if someone inches toward your lane and grazes the lane marker, even if they don't merge. It also won't see people obviously merging into your lane, and will brake late once the car is fully in the lane. If you attempt to change lanes to pass someone, adaptive cruise control will start braking as you are diagonally passing the car because it thinks you're going to hit the car (even if you're 3+ car lengths back) and attempting to pass. The system is overly cautious and is way worse than I expected.

* Using the screen to control everything is mind-bogglingly frustrating. Everything is *juust* out of reach while your back is against the seat, and the screen can't pivot towards you. So you not only have to take your eyes off the road for way too long to find anything you also have to reach to tap it. And since the icons/buttons are relatively small, if you're driving while trying to tap something, small bumps in the road will make it nearly impossible to tap the correct selection on the first try. You have to stabilize your hand on the edge of the screen. Contrasting with Apple Car Play, which has big, widely separated icons that are easy to tap/navigate, this is just bad.

* The Siri-like voice-activated controller is terrible. Especially when trying to call people, even someone on my favorites or someone I've called a million times. E.g. ""Call Joe Shmoe"" ""...calling Shannon Example."" Again, now I have to take my eyes off the road for way to long to navigate, find, and call someone. Same problem happens with speech to text for texting someone. This is especially a problem for me because my friends/family have non-typical/American names. Siri can recognize the names, but the Tesla can't.

* Navigation is not great. Everything is a shade of white/grey/black. So since everything is on the same screen, it's hard to see where your next turn/direction is. Contrasting with Google Maps, where the next step/direction is outlined in a dark green (high contrast) box that makes it super easy to identify. Then, if you try to change your music, the location of the directions section on the screen also changes. And for some reason, the audio settings for the navigation almost always gets set to mute every time I drive, so I always have to manually adjust it back so I can hear where I need to go. (I made sure it was set to the correct volume in the menu, and it still goes to mute)

* The audio doesn't/can't always connect to Spotify or my phone, so sometimes I have to drive in silence. Happens about 25% of the time, but has gotten much better in recent months.

* Regenerative braking is applied when lifting off the throttle. You cannot coast. I knew this when getting the car and thought I would get used to it, which for the most part I did, but it really makes driving a lot more taxing. You always have to be in perfect control of the throttle if you want to just coast, otherwise you're either accelerating or decelerating.

* There are no blind-spot monitors. Every car I know of has blind spot monitors. This doesn't even so much as chime when you turn your blinker on while another car is in your blind spot. They used to highlight a surrounding car in red (on the center screen) if your blinker is on and they're in your blind-spot, now they have the side camera activate when you turn on your blinker. But who checks the center screen when trying to change lanes to the left or right? That's bad design. Also, the car has slightly smaller-than-average side mirrors. Note: I have my mirrors adjusted correctly to see my blind-spots clearly. I still like have blind-spot monitors (just in case). 

* The AC/Heat controls are not great. Again, requiring too much attention off the road to control. Also, you can't turn off the driver's side vents and only have the passenger's open. And the opposite is true as well: you can't turn off the passenger's vent's and have the driver's open. 

* The smartphone proximity enabled door-unlocking works, but sometimes there is a small delay of about 3 seconds. Happens at the most inconvenient times, it seems. I have to pull out my phone, check and see that my bluetooth is enabled and the app is open on my phone, then I try the door again and by that time it has recognized my phone and it's proximity, and it works. To clarify, in the above anecdote bluetooth is on and the app is open the whole time.

* The rear camera is sometimes choppy/laggy when reversing.

* When using autopilot on the freeway/highway at night, the high beams will come on unless there is a car within about ~500 feet in front of you, in which case it will use low beams. Using your brights on the freeway with other cars around (within about a quarter mile, I'd say) can create glare/distraction and is generally unsafe, both for cars on your side of the freeway and for motorists on the other side. So when the brights come on, I have to take it out of autopilot and steer manually until it notices more cars around. (Note: you cannot use autopilot at night without headlights set to automatic high beam.)

**TL;DR:** Ultimately, the main reason I'm getting rid of the car is because of the screen. It's a huge gimmick. It's difficult to use/navigate, and requires too much attention off the road to get anything done. This is the right car for some people, but isn't the right car for me. I'm going to miss the great, instant acceleration/torque. But I want something with regular knobs/buttons and apple car play.

**EDIT 1:** The cars I'm considering next are either a CT4-V (non-Blackwing) with SuperCruise, or a Genesis G70.

**EDIT 2:** THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT AND I COMPLETELY FORGOT. Tesla no longer allows you to purchase OR sell your car at the end of your lease. They force you to return the car to them. This means that when the lease was over, I wouldn't be able to sell the car to CarMax to make money on the car. I think this is super unethical because I see a lease as me ~~purchasing~~ renting a car with an agreement that the car company *can* take the car back at the end of the lease (emphasis on ""can""). The ~~purchaser~~ customer should have the right to do what they want with the car, whether that means buy it out or sell it to a third party. This is specifically a problem because when I ~~bought~~ leased the car I specifically asked, ""will I be able to sell the car to a third party dealership?"" and the answer was ""yes."" Three months after I had the car, they changed that rule all of a sudden and now forced to give your car back (or transfer the lease, which is what I'm doing). When leasing a car, the increased equity (due to the car shortage) belongs to the ~~BUYER~~ customer, not the manufacturer. Apparently more and more automakers are doing this, which I think is entirely messed up.

**EDIT 3:** I want to clarify something: I'm not frustrated that I couldn't buy the car- that part was always clear. I'm frustrated that I couldn't *sell* the car. 

In the contract it specifically says that you cannot buy the car at the end of the lease. However, it didn't specifically exclude third-party dealership buyouts. I also asked the salesman and Tesla financial *before* getting the lease if they would allow a buyout from a third-party dealership, and they both said ""yes.""

The issue is that it seems unethical to change the terms of an agreement after the agreement was made. (This was not specifically stated in the contract, that it would allow third-party dealership buyouts. But it also wasn't specifically prohibited. There was also a section in Tesla's online account that allowed you to ""Sell Car to Dealer"" and request a buyout amount.)

When Tesla did that, I felt like they were taking something that, in my mind, I felt was mine: 

1. The freedom to get out of the lease how and when I wanted to.
2. The money that would have been mine if I sold to a dealership. (Specifically, market value minus the sum of the residual value plus the remaining lease payments)

From a strictly financial perspective, I understand that it was not a purchase, and that I never had equity. Those were the wrong words to use. My main point was that I had a certain idea of how leases work, and what my lease-end options would be. Ultimately, those options were limited to my disadvantage, and I felt frustrated about that.",3538,1089,2022-01-27 02:14:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/sdfxdq/im_getting_rid_of_my_2021_tesla_model_3_long/

cars,delayed,What's the next car brand to die?,"As it looks like the global economy heads into a period of decline, albeit likely better than 2007-2008 where we lost GM's Pontiac, Saturn and Saab, Ford's Mercury, each recession seems to lead to the discontinuation of a brand.

2001 saw the end of Plymouth, whether linked to the relatively light 2000 recession, and a delayed AMC buy-out after the 70s stagflation and inability to reposition after the energy crisis ended are just other examples in my mind.

**So what brands do we see not making it to 2030?**

My personal pick is Chrysler as it's stuck making a single model, the Pacifica and its derivatives, and Infiniti due to a lack of investment from Nissan and plans for EVs.

But any others that are at risk of being on the chopping block?

cars,delayed,"You broke my heart, BMW","Forgive the ensuing wall of text/soliloquy. I'd posted this on a throwaway at first, but F it. I'm just broken hearted.

**tl;dr BMW Service cured my ""affliction""**

I've lusted for BMWs for years. [I was this kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYA_IHM6YUU), albeit with BMWs (and also Porsches, but also mainly BMWs). And I still remember exactly where I was the moment I first knew I wanted one: July '97, Long Beach Island, NJ, playing mini-golf just off Long Beach Boulevard, when a Estoril Blue E36 M3 tore past. I was hooked. Or rather, ""truly afflicted.""

July 4, 2015, I finally got it: 2012 135i, 23k miles, just off lease, CPO'd, in Le Mans Blue (closest I could get to Estoril). I was in love.

I'd done my homework and knew what I was getting into though. Thus going CPO (more mileage on the warranty than new, and more money to save for a rainy day) and springing for the extra two years of ""BMW Ultimate Care"" maintenance. And sure enough, over time I ran into all the common problems I'd read about: DCT lurch; water pump failure; charge pipe failure; premature ignition coil failures; various gasket failures, etc.

Frustrating as it could be, problem child or not, it wasn't anything I hadn't planned for and worth the trade offs. 

No more. Not because of the car itself, but rather because the quality (or lack thereof) of service from BMWNA and its dealers'.

The beginning of the end was in April of this year. I was due for a fair number of service items. Specifically:

* Oil/oil filter
* Cabin filter
* Intake filter
* Spark plugs
* Rear rotors, pads
* Brake fluid
* Wiper blades

I'd also recently had the car go into limp mode and throw a CEL, with a dozen or so codes returning when I scanned the car. Giving the car a good once over, I spotted a few more possible warranty issues: the charge pipe appeared to be cracked and was visibly leaking blow-by oil; the coolant expansion tank was visibly cracked and leaking; the oil pan appeared to have/have had a leak; and the valve cover/valve cover gasket had a leak.

I made an appointment with the closest dealer to me at the time, *NYC Area BMW #1*. On checking in the car, the SA took note of nothing I told him beyond an oil change and that I ""asked that the car be given a once over.""

He called 20 minutes later, saying everything checked out and my car was ready to be picked up. They did the oil change and... that was it. They didn't even clear the codes and CEL. When I pointed to the still-illuminated CEL, the SA reiterated that the car had checked out and was ""fine.""

I made an appointment at another area dealer before I'd even left the service bay.

On my first visit to *NYC Area Dealer #2*, I made a point of explicitly listing off everything that needed to be addressed... all the covered maintenance that was due, all the codes I'd pulled, and all the issues I spotted. I also brought along three separate print-outs with everything: one page with a typed list of the the maintenance items; one with the raw codes I pulled; and one with a typed list of the physical warranty issues I spotted, with a brief description of what I saw. And I followed up with all the above in an email afterwards.

As he was getting a mileage reading and physically inspecting the car, the SA said, quote, ""it's pretty normal for the gaskets and charge pipe to leak, those are fine."" He noted none of the specifics on the intake paperwork, but assured me that he everything I passed along would be looked at and addressed.

On pick-up, they had changed the valve cover gasket and front O2 sensor. I explicitly asked about the charge pipe, coolant expansion tank, and oil pan gasket. The SA again stated that it was ""normal"" for those to leak a bit and they appeared to be ""fine.""

I asked about what they found regarding the litany of codes, given the car had dropped into limp mode while at speed on the highway. I was told that they cleared them, took the car for a test drive, didn't see them come up again, and so it wasn't a problem as far as they were concerned.

Finally, the maintenance items: they only did the wiper blades. With respect to plugs, brakes, filters, etc... the SA said they weren't due, and items that were covered under BMW Ultimate Care anyway. Pressing him on the former, I was told they go strictly by what the service computer in the car says. Oil/lube tech reset all the things, instead of just the oil change counter? Doesn't matter what any of the paperwork or electronic history says; you're SOL. On the latter (what BMW Ultimate Care covers), I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt as what was covered did change significantly for the 2015MY. He refused to look over the documentation though. I asked for a service manager at that point; I was told none were available.

I gave up and left... only for the car to go into limp mode again. Great.

I went back and spoke with one of the service managers the following week. They agreed to look at the car again, but said they'd charge me 1 hour labor out-of-pocket, irrespective of whether any warranty issues were found. He said as they'd just looked at the car, they couldn't bill BMW for it so I'd have to eat it. WTF? But he says they'll cover all the maintenance items, so I cave and make the appointment.

The SA gives me the same spiel, saying it's normal for all the stuff to leak but they'll *really really pinky promise I swear* give the car a good look this time. No sooner does he say that then the coolant expansion tank shatters and dumps a few gallons of blue fluid all over the service bay. ""I guess we can warranty that now."" Don't say?

I get the car back, and... same BS. They swapped the coolant expansion tank and left it at that. The maintenance items? Nope. The codes? Cleared them, didn't see them come back on a brief test drive, no further action. The oil pan gasket? The charge pipe? Didn't even look at them. That BS labor charge? They ""did me a solid"" and cut it to a half hour... even with warranty work.

I gave up. The warranty was up, the dealer wouldn't budge, and I'd be damned if I was going to pay them out of pocket.

Until the charge pipe blew up a few weeks later.

I was able to get BMWNA looped in at that point and gave them the full run down. They took a few weeks to get back to me (during which time I replaced the charge pipe myself), only to say that they'd need the car brought to a dealer to be inspected first. At my expense. I took it to *NYC Area dealer #3*, who were actually decent: they did the inspection and gave me a loaner for the day, for free. Props to them. What do they find? Sure enough, the oil pan gasket was leaking. And so was the valve cover gasket... again. They also pointed out that I was due for cabin and intake filters, and suggested plugs as well. Who'd have thought?

BMWNA gets back to me again some time later with their offer: 5% percent off. Yep, five whole percent. And while I can't find the message from them at the moment, I believe that was just off the part cost... which was ~$100 against ~$2500 in labor.

*NYC Area dealer #3* said I might have better luck if I route it through the dealer that caused the issue. Apparently BMWNA allocates a limited number of goodwill dollars to each BMWNA regional manager, who in turn are understandably loathe to cover something if their dealer(s) aren't the ones at fault. Fine, fair enough.

Another three months of intermittent back and forth with *NYC Area Dealer #2*... delayed/cancelled appointments, life getting in the way, etc.... and finally got it back in to them today. As far as maintenance, they were only willing to cover the plugs. The valve cover gasket? They say it's not actually leaking; everyone else that's look at it (other dealer, indy shop, friend, and myself) mustn't know what they're doing. Oh, and they offered a whole 15% off the oil pan gasket repair. The service manager claimed that was the hard cap set for goodwill repairs by BMWNA. Can't even be honest with me about that? Can't just tell me straight that you're not willing to do anything more for me?

I can put up with the more frequent maintenance, I can deal with all the ""wear items"" (looking at you, water pump), and I can afford the hole it blows in my bank account.

Putting up with this level of ""service"" though? I don't know what exactly I feel. It's like the end of any relationship though: bargaining, coming to terms with it being over, knowing the love is lost, and that it'll never be the same. It's over, I'm done.

I guess all I can say is: thanks, BMW; you cured my affliction.

*edit: formatting; a word; removed dealer names per mods*

*11/15/18 -- BMWNA reached out to me. They wanted to clarify that the offer was* **10%** *off, not* **5%** *off... and that none of that was being kicked in by BMWNA, but rather directly by NYC Area dealer #3. So BMWNA takes no responsibility and offers nothing.

The conversation went like this:

**BMWNA rep**: I hear your frustrations dealers are independently owned, so any issues are between you and the dealer.

**Me**: The maintenance and warranty plans are via BMWNA; does the responsibility for fulfilling those terms not ultimately lie with BMWNA?

**BMWNA rep**: I hear your frustrations. Dealers are franchised and independently owned. If there were any issues with the service received, we can relay to the dealer that there was an issue, but it's between you and the dealer to resolve.

**Me**: And what happens when multiple dealers across multiple service visits fail to diagnose and repair the car? The warranty is via BMWNA; where does the buck stop, who is the warrantor, if not BMWNA?

And What happens for maintenance items that were due, that we can clearly see were due by doing nothing more than cross referencing the service history against the service manual, that were not done? There's no equivocation with those, and those are things I already paid BMWNA for.

**BMWNA rep**: I hear your frustrations. Dealers are franchised and independently owned, so it's between you and the dealer. I'm not going to give you the run around: as far as BMW covering this, that's never going to happen. Based on a number of factors, from brand loyalty to dealer loyalty, the regional manager made the determination not to cover anything in July. The 10% you received was from the dealer [BMW Ridgefield]. As nothing has changed since then, that offer stands.

**Me**: So it's not BMWNA's responsibility as warrantor to fulfill the term of the warranty? The proverbial buck doesn't stop with BMWNA? It'd be like if I ordered a pizza from Dominos, prepaid for it, had it never show, had the individual store tell me ""too bad, so sad,"" and then had Dominos corporate tell me they ""hear my frustrations"" and promptly do nothing. At minimum, you have no responsibility as owner and franchisor of the brand to force resolutions?

And unlike the pizza scenario, I didn't purchase the ""pizza,"" or rather the warranty and service plans, from an independent dealer. They were purchased and warranted/guaranteed by BMWNA. Given that, how does BMWNA as guarantor/warrantor not bear some burden in fulfilling the terms?

**BMWNA rep**: I hear your frustrations. It would actually be like that. Why would it be a corporate issue if your Dominos order never got delivered? The dealers are independently owned and operated franchises...

cars,delayed,Launch Control is still silly. I updated my sorted list of 5-60mph times to better reflect cars' real life acceleration performance.,"It's been more than a year since I did [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/i6qdmx/launch_control_is_silly_i_compiled_and_sorted_a/). Since then many new cars have come out and I thought it's appropriate for me to update the test a little.

For context, many popular magazines that do 0-60 tests on new vehicles measure them with the use of launch control. This mostly eliminates the effect of turbo lag, throttle delay and power delivery curve difference for many high performance cars that would all make significant differences in real life situations. Further more many American magazines subtract rollout time from their 0-60 result, which further downplays the difference in traction between different setups.

Which is why Car and Driver's 5-60 time is in my opinion the most accurate gauge of real life ""stomp-and-go"" acceleration scenario. So here is the updated list, with one additional column at the end (+x.xs) for some cars showing the discrepancy between the 0-60 and the 5-60 time. The larger this gap is the less representative is the car's 0-60 number of its real life capability. 

I've also removed cars from the previous list if there are newer models available.

Bolded entries are new ones added this time.

**Edit**: I'm using C&D's numbers only because it's one way to keep the comparison *consistent*. I'm not saying they are more or less accurate than other publisher's tests, but there should be minimal variance in test methodology between each car on this list.

Further more, this isn't a ""which car is better"" list. There is so much more to a car than acceleration, and there is so much more to acceleration than 5-60 stomp and go. 5-60 just paints a *slice* of the whole picture, but I think it's a more relevant slice than most people realize.",1429,537,2022-08-04 00:56:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/wfflk9/launch_control_is_still_silly_i_updated_my_sorted/
cars,delayed,"SSC officially acknowledges that the Tuatara did not hit the claimed speeds of 331mph or 301mph, 9 months after their initial record attempt was disproven.","In a statement posted to their Instagram page ssc\_northamerica, the company said:

""We have seen your questions for months now and understand your frustrations. If it hasn‚Äôt been made clear up to this point, we would like to acknowledge officially that we did not reach the originally claimed speeds of 331 MPH or even 301 MPH in October of 2020. We were truly heartbroken as a company to learn that we did not reach this feat, and we are in an ongoing effort to break the 300 MPH barrier transparently, officially, and undoubtedly. We also want to thank all of those who were supportive and understanding of our unexpected incident in April that has delayed our top speed efforts.""

Context: In October 2020, SSC completed a world record attempt for top speed of a production car with the SSC Tuatara. The attempt took place on a highway in the Nevada desert, the same location at which Koenigsegg had successfully set the world record of 277.9mph with the Agera RS. After the attempt was published online, some skeptics emerged that something was fishy. To the best of my knowledge, the first person to raise the alarm was someone named Jey Cee ([www.instagram.com/jey\_.\_cee/](https://www.instagram.com/jey_._cee/)) who did some very simple math/physics to prove the Tuatara couldn't have hit 331mph and shared his findings on the ""Koenigsegg 4 Life"" Facebook group. This work was then seen by YouTubers Misha Charoudin and Tim Burton (Shmee150) who made videos analyzing the run using the same math and published their conclusions for the world to see (Examples: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3daTG4\_JS\_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3daTG4_JS_4) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPXXGTuQKbk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPXXGTuQKbk) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSNRKBj\_hUE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSNRKBj_hUE)).

I even got passed by and followed a white NA Miata with 1 headlight on for a few kilometers. We've owned this car for 5 years and I feel like I never actually drove it until now.

I always liked trucks and SUV's due to their offroad prowess, letting you get places most vehicles can't go. I never really cared about sports cars and shit because its like oh wow, I can go through a corner 20km/h faster than normal before I hit the next red light in 30ft. Cool (not really).

But now. Holy shit, I really get it now. I want to drive a Miata lol.

cars,highway,Recent almost robbed/scammed while driving on a highway.,"On the highway a few days ago I was driving along until some man pulls up besides me. He rolls down his window and begins pointing at my tire and yelling for me to ""pull over"". Now on my car it tells me if any of my tires air pressure has lowered. So obviously this man couldn't be telling the truth. He followed me for around 20 minutes making motions for me to pull over. He eventually pulled in front of me on the highway and used his blinkers telling me to pull over. At this moment I became kinda freaked out and just ignored him. Eventually he gave up and took a exit. When I arrived at my destination I inspected my tire and car. Nothing was wrong with it. This really freaked me out. I'm just wondering what could've happened if I pulled over. Would he of robbed me? I've heard of scam a while back where on the road someone will tell you ""your tire is popped"" then pull over with you. They would then call a fake company and a fake repair van would pull up behind you. You would pay the repair van money to fix a tire that isn't already broken. I'm writing this to warn others about any similar contact. Never pull over with a stranger, unless they're a cop in a police car.

cars,highway,"Rear Tire blew on my Corvette on the Highway, Runflats did their Job","Well my day was going great today, long weekend, went for a nice drive and on my way home my passenger rear tire decided to blow out on the highway as I'm doing 120kph. Went from 36psi to 0 in a second. I didn't hit anything so I'm guessing I picked up something that decided to dislodge itself from the tire shortly after I got onto the highway (401 for you Canadians).

  
Thankfully its a runflat tire and besides hearing a very loud bang as if I hit something the car didn't skip a beat. It didn't lose control or pull left or right, it just kept tracking straight as the runflat did its job and prevented the tire from collapsing after it lost all tire pressure.

  
Also thankfully it happened when it did because I was at the exact distance to drive on the tire home. A runflat tire is rated to last about 50 miles up to a maximum speed of 50mph and I was right at that distance from home when it happened. As soon as I pulled onto my residential street I could feel the tire lose its runflat properties and start to act like a normal flat tire. It felt like I swapped out my round tire for a square tire.

  
Luckily the local dealer is 2minutes from my house, however now that the tire is completely shot I won't risk limping it around the corner. I will have to wait until Tuesday after the long weekend and order a new set of tires and organize a flatbed for 1km.

I know people like to complain about runflats because they make the ride quality more stiff, but I would rather have a runflat instead of being stuck on the side of the road waiting for a flatbed.

  
All 4 of my tires are pretty bald as well (thanks GM for forcing Cup 2R's on a Z07) so they needed to be replaced soon anyway but I'm in awe at how composed the car was when the tire gave out, it wasn't scary at all  and they come as advertised.

he looked at traffic and back and, sees the person, slamming on the brakes. But it was too late, and hits the person in front. Now, he had to get it towed since the bumper came completely off and the engine is damaged. A new car is needed.

cars,highway,"Inside The High Stakes World of Tokyo's Highway Loop Racers, the Roulettezoku „Äå„É´„Éº„É¨„ÉÉ„ÉàÊóè„Äç","Hey guys, in this post I want to talk about one of the underground street racing subcultures of Japan; the *Roulettezoku* „Äå„É´„Éº„É¨„ÉÉ„ÉàÊóè„Äçwhich literally translates to ‚ÄúRoulette Tribe‚Äù. It‚Äôs a term that not many in the west know, because it is mainly used by the Japanese police to specifically refer to the *hashiriya* „ÄåËµ∞„ÇäÂ±ã„Äçor street racers who run the inner city highways of Tokyo; mainly the C1 Loop and Wangan line.

It's also a term that I only learned recently. Most people just use the catch-all term *hashiriya,* but since the term *Roulettezoku* is specific to the Japanese highway racers, I wanted to introduce it to the west since a quick google search reveals not a single post related to the topic.

The subculture of the *Roulettezoku* is famous because of anime like Wangan Midnight and especially the legend of the famous street racing gang *Mid Night* that used to terrorize the streets in the mid 90s.

Oh yeah, about me, I'm Albo. I've been living in Japan for 8 years, and for 5 years I've been researching and making documentaries about the underground drifting scene in Gunma prefecture; the real life version of the anime Initial D. However since I recently moved to Tokyo, I decided to dive into the underground car scene here.

Since there are no *touge* (winding mountain roads) inside central Tokyo, the racing scenes that evolved here were drifting industrial park areas, drag races at traffic lights, and street racing on the inner-city highways of Tokyo. I find the *Roulettezoku* fascinating because many of them are so different from the drifters of Gunma.

In Gunma, many of the drifters I met were in their early 20s. They would be really into drifting for several years until they eventually got married, had kids and gave up the sportscars in favor of sensible family cars.

However in Tokyo, many of the *hashiriya* are rich businessmen of means who ride the loop with Audis, Lamborghinis, Ferrarris, Porsches etc. That being said, they do come from all walks of life and range in age from 18 to 65+. They drive everything from Suzuki Cappucinos to Honda NSX, to brand new Subaru WRX STis.  It's surprising how varied and vibrant the scene is, though it's a shadow of its former glory days 20 years ago.

One of the interesting things is how most of the *Roulettezoku* are generally quite considerate about other motorists, and so they only race very late at night when the highway is mostly empty, and if they come upon traffic up ahead, they slow down and the race or time trial ends. Almost everyone lives by a sort of ""code"".

The other really interesting thing is how the police more or less tolerate the existence of the *Roulettezoku*. They almost never engage in actual car chases, and most of the fines they hand out tend to be for car modifications, not for speed violations

Anyway, hope you guys enjoyed my little write up. To be completely straight up, I wrote this writeup to complement the latest video in my documentary series about Japanese underground car culture. If you enjoyed the article, I would ofcourse love for you to check it out here and I'm more than happy to do an AMA in the thread!

cars,jam,"A Lambo V10 makes the perfect commuter, even if your credit score starts with a '4'","I work at a mid-range luxury dealership in the F&I department (think of the brand that sounds like ‚Äòoweee‚Äô when you bring it in for service), and as I‚Äôm sure you can imagine, we get all kinds of folks coming in sold on their dream cars. Sadly, once they reach my office, some of those dreams get squashed. 

Take out your grandfather clocks and wind the time back to 2018 where I was green as grass in F&I and didn‚Äôt know my ass from a hole in the ground when it came to getting deals approved. This was around the time when my store had decided to stop wholesaling cars and realized that we should keep everything and anything with 4 wheels and an engine.
 
Enter Dave.

Dave had stumbled in from the boonies looking for something with good road presence at bargain basement pricing for his new up and coming real estate business. Something with a big ass engine, loads of gadgets and a cushy suspension to whisk clients around in luxury. He‚Äôd landed himself with our top sales rep, and wouldn‚Äôt you know it? They found the perfect car to match Dave‚Äôs need for ballin‚Äô on a budget.

It was a 2010 S6 with a massive V10 in the front and only 95000 kms on the clock originally purchased from my store. I had taken this badboy on trade back in 2015 for a new SQ5, and its claim to fame was that my client had both its main keys stolen from his house, along with his brand-new Maserati Gran Turismo. 

Thankfully, he had the travel key with him, and the car was parked safely at the airport while he was away on a business trip. He ended up having to get a new locking assembly and getting the whole ignition system replaced when he returned. Crazy stuff‚Ä¶ 

After I took it on trade, we sold it for the second time, and then it was traded into us again when that owner decided he wanted the new V8 version. Both gents who had owned it had cared for it meticulously, and depreciation had slapped it hard enough to land in the ballin‚Äô budget range. Jam-packed with full service records and a good story - it was the perfect car for Dave.

Dave ended up buying the car for about $30k all in and it turned out to be me who had the privilege of getting the financing done. They‚Äôd put the deal together at a standard rate around 6% in hopes that we‚Äôd use a lender specializing in older units. My sales rep said he seemed like a solid dude and approval should be a slam dunk. He had his own website, which in our simple minds meant he must be a big deal. Cool beans.

We do the credit app, I do my warranty & product pitch, and send Dave on his merry way anticipating pick up for a couple of days later. That‚Äôs when I realize how bass-ackwards we do things up here in Canadaland. 

This poor guy had more write offs on his bureau than you‚Äôd see on an Amazon balance sheet. I had no idea what to do ‚Äì to that point, every client I‚Äôd dealt with was a sparkling A1 credit diamond and I now had a lump of coal to work with. The bank we‚Äôd hoped to work with was coming back with a hard no and it was looking like I‚Äôll have to crush this man‚Äôs dreams.

Thankfully, we were set up with one subprime lender, and they were the beacon of hope that would get this man his Lambo power. I‚Äôd called Dave to see what kind of down payment we could squeeze, and he‚Äôd saved up about $9k from not paying anyone back and closing off a few deals. Could this be it?

I fire off the app, and it comes back approved at a rate so high I almost puked. Most of our business was sub-vented rate at that point, so we‚Äôd normally see rates of 2-5%. With older units like this, usually rates were around 6 or 7%. The rate they‚Äôd given him in this case was 16%!!!! Are you guys insane???

I had to call them to be sure, thinking there‚Äôs no way in hell that‚Äôs even legal. Maybe it‚Äôs a mistake. 

It definitely was not a mistake. Based on his credit history the lender told me they‚Äôd normally require a $1000 GPS to be installed on the car, but would get rid of that need in this case. Thanks guys‚Ä¶

I let Dave know what the deal was, and he was thrilled! He was approved for his dream car and it was ONLY at 16% (his words, not mine). I guess he was expecting higher? 

To those of you who‚Äôve been in the car biz and have dealt with subprime buyers, you‚Äôre probably noticing that I‚Äôd forgotten to do something. Every single subprime deal needs proof of income from paystubs, bank statements, pounds of flesh, whatever it may be. Me, in my la-la land fantasy world had no clue about that. I saw the green light, and said let‚Äôs get this baby rolled!

Dave came in, paid his dues and got out of dodge faster than a speeding bullet. It was a whirlwind of papers flying in my office so he could get the keys and open his new baby up.

With all the hub-bub I‚Äôd made about getting this deal approved, one of my more experienced colleagues had asked me about how Dave proved his income after he had already hit the road. Real estate agents are notorious for having messy POI as I‚Äôve now learned, but at that point I looked at my colleague like he was stupid. Our clientele never need proof of income, what are you smoking?

He then enlightened me that everyone needs proof of income when you‚Äôre in Dave‚Äôs boat, and that I should double check my deal to make sure it‚Äôll fly. Sure enough, there it was in the mandatory stipulations at the bottom of my approval - PROOF OF INCOME UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED.

Oh FML‚Ä¶might have to start hunting for a new gig once the boss hears about this.

I called Dave immediately and it went straight to voicemail‚Ä¶ then again 20 minutes later and no response. I emailed him and got nothing but crickets. Looks like the ship is going down boys - been great while it lasted. It was close to the end of the day, so I decided to call it a night and deal with it in the morning.

The next day, as soon as I got in the office, my phone started ringing off the hook. It‚Äôs Dave! He‚Äôd gotten a nail in his tire on the way home and wanted to see about us fixing it. Someone was looking out for me that day.

I said sure thing, let me get service involved‚Ä¶and oh by the way, can you send me your last 2 commission statements and your last 6 months of bank statements? Sure thing corp, I‚Äôll be there in an hour.

An hour goes by, then 2, then 3. I‚Äôm starting to sweat now‚Ä¶what if he ghosted me again? 

Just as I‚Äôm about to break the news to my sales manager, I see a murdered out S6 roll up. It‚Äôs Dave!!!!

He‚Äôd gone to the bank to get all of his statements printed, and had his commission statements ready to rock. He‚Äôd also initially declined warranty, but now realized that it was probably a huge mistake on that car. Cool beans, but now we‚Äôve gotta redo all of the financing.

I bring him in to my office, and the lender has capped him completely. They wouldn‚Äôt even let me add a nickel to this deal... how the hell are we supposed to get this done?

At this point, we needed to get creative. My manufacturer has a program with no credit check where they‚Äôll finance you a warranty on a credit card at 0% with only a 10% down payment and the taxes up front. It helps make the cost a bit more‚Ä¶palatable. Some of these warranties are crazy expensive after all (this one being no exception).

Dave agreed this would have to be the way, and he pulls out a wallet that would make George Costanza‚Äôs look like a clutch purse. He pulled out a few cards and slapped them on my desk to do some credit card roulette.

We try them one at a time, and finally land on the one with just enough room to cover the down payment. BOOM! Dave signs the papers in another flurry, and we slap hands just as I see the green light pop up saying we‚Äôre all clear on his income. How the hell did we pull this one off?

He had his tire fixed lickety-split thanks to the fine folks in service, and next thing I know I hear a roaring V10 climbing to the redline as he leaves the parking lot. Good thing you decided to get the warranty my guy.



EDIT: Appreciate the overwhelming support and positive feedback from everyone in the community! Glad you guys enjoyed the story. 

For those of you curious, [here's a link to the carfax](https://vhr.carfax.ca/?id=mYlVahw%2FKMimKkGMWzsn1gJVMsho8Am1) Looks like the car just changed hands again about a week ago.

cars,jam,Left Lane Dicks: The cause of road rage,"It doesn't matter if you're going the speed limit. You may feel like you're doing the right thing by slowing a speeder down, or you may feel it's your RIGHT to drive in any lane you 'darn well please.'

You're not. It's not.
And you ARE breaking the law.

Here's how it is DESIGNED to work:
You're in what you think is just like any other lane except that it's 'fast'. Someone approaches you from behind at 64mph (and you look down to see you're going 57mph and you switch to your smug 'justified' face because the sign says 55). While rather close in proximity, the driver begs you to move over.

Oh, how you should.

But you don't.

The driver tries to be patient and now cars start lining up behind both of you. There's a quick flash of the brights, (Which means the driver would like to pass) and if you look up from your phone you either move over, or your ego decides that you'll be stubborn (and in some cases actually slow down ON PURPOSE). In most cases you don't even notice the signal (flash to pass) but you just start complaining about the guy riding your bumper.

Now there's four or five vehicles lining up behind you while you have a LOT of distance ahead of you and enough room to move over. Now the sixth vehicle back finally jets across two lanes of traffic to go around not only you and the cars behind you, but but also around the slower cars in the two lanes to your right, only to find that there's no GOOD reason for you to be IN THE WAY.

Note that he used the 'SLOW' lane to do this in and dangerously passes on the right.

Move over. You don't have to be stubborn. It's not your lane. You don't have to be self-righteous. Please be part of the solution. Don't cause traffic jams and contribute to road rage.",1375,918,2014-04-30 20:13:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/24dc5p/left_lane_dicks_the_cause_of_road_rage/

That's right - my dream car is a 15 year old Acura TSX with 130,000 miles! I mean, not really - but I am a broke motherfucker! I live with my parents! A brand new Versa Note isn't even in my budget right now. But you do you *Lambro's*!

Really sexy shade of blue/gray tho, high performance engine, amazing transmission - reliable and cheap so... 

Real handbrake too - can't say that about a 911! And it's way easier to sleep in! The 350watt stereo system makes for a beefed up electrical system easily capable of running a panini press - more than adequate for reheating McDonald's sandwiches the next day! 4 cupholders too! Shit's nicer than my non-existent house. Certainly better insulated ü§£!!

Nothing compares to that feeling of pumping 2, maybe 3 whole gallons of premium gasoline in before my credit card gets declined! It is a high compression engine after all! Can't be putting 87 octane in like a peasant.11.5:1 can you believe that? Purrs like a little Japanese cat in the mornings. Course sometime you're in a state with high gas taxes - then you'll cheat and put in regular, it does already have 130k on it (what damage you gonna do at this point?).

The full-size spare is so practical! It's basically a Jeep Wrangler! Really helps when you can't afford to pay for a new front driver side tire when that finally dies. Oh and don't put the seat back up too far - it will go off the track and jam.

Higher top speed than any new Volvo's tho hahahahaha

Really though, I love the car - just wish I wasn't so broke. Maybe I'll be able to afford an Acura TL Type-S in 5 years after I've driven this TSX into the ground.",1548,280,2019-03-06 06:43:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/axsuhy/just_bought_my_dream_car/

cars,jam,"How much should a decent, but not showroom quality paint job cost (single color, not changing color, engine bay, jams, etc.)?","My little corrado has been with me for 18 years at this point. I used to take extremely good care of the paint, but when I moved to a high elevation state, the paint just... died. The clearcoat fogged and started peeling and I never really had the money to get anything other than a rattlecan job. So I never did anything.

Now that I'm a bit older and finally have a bit of money, my first order of business is to essentially ""restore"" the car. So in the next few months I plan on stripping the car (interior and engine bay) and sending it off for bodywork and paint. (Yes, stripping it is necessary, much of the interior wiring has shorted somewhere and fuses blow for a lot of the interior things, so I plan on pretty much making a new harness.. and I figured if I'm going to do this, I may as well make the engine bay pretty as well. Nothing extravagant, just new paint and heat protection stickers on the hood and maybe some tidier routing for hoses and wires.)

Anyway, I have no idea how much a paint job should cost. Sure, you can get really cheap ones for what... a grand? But I want a paint job that will last for the remainder of this car's life (properly taken care of... of course.) The car is silver and I want it to be painted with the original paint code, so no color change. There is one or two minor dents... unfortunately one of them is on the back corner of the car, in a very difficult to repair spot. One is just a normal dent on the roof. The entire car needs prepped and painted. Nothing is salvageable. There is very little rust on the car, mainly around the dent and bad bondo after the last paint job (before I bought it.) But nothing is rusted through, it's all surface. The rear bumper is also the wrong color (I got rear-ended, resulting in a ruined bumper and the aforementioned dent.) I plan on delivering the car to the shop on a flatbed, with literally everything I can strip off of the car stripped (within reason of course, it's gotta roll..). I don't know what options there are for getting a paint job, but I want the paint to essentially be as durable as OEM, but... better (cause OEM paint often has many imperfections.) Again, I know this will depend on location, but just humor me.",2,28,2020-02-09 06:11:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/f10q2m/how_much_should_a_decent_but_not_showroom_quality/

I would be lying if I said I didn't feel jealous when some kids in high school got brand new E46 M3s just for getting good grades on SATs. Back then I set M3 as my dream car to own.

I still remember the excitement I felt when I put deposit down for a custom ordered F80 M3 almost 4 years ago. I remember [tracking its progress](https://imgur.com/sPTEaBn) during production (I even stalked the delivery ship on some maritime tracking site) with the kind of anticipation that I haven't felt since being a kid waiting for a big present. I remember seeing it parked inside the delivery bay on the [day of delivery](https://i.imgur.com/YefrX94.jpg) and couldn't believe that just 10 years ago, it was still nothing more than a dumb teenager's pipe dream.

During the past three and half years I put on close to 40k miles on the car. It's been stuck in god awful Bay Area traffic jams, gone to [beautiful national parks](https://i.imgur.com/7rd4WMT.jpg), torn through [twisty mountain roads](https://i.imgur.com/NEHWIwZ.jpg), bathed in [oceanside sunsets](https://i.imgur.com/1IPVZvp.jpg), looked right at home on [scenic drives](https://i.imgur.com/7zzhIPL.jpg) and got its butt kicked [on racetracks](https://i.imgur.com/cqDa4Us.jpg) by BR-Zs and Miatas(Ok this wasn't exactly the car's fault).

In the end it was everything I ever wanted my dream car to be and more. It's not even close to a perfect car and I can go on and on about its drawbacks but it's the car I missed the most afterwards. I didn't love it because of its flaws, I loved it *despite* its flaws. I can still close my eyes and feel the thick M steering wheel in my hands, the cold smooth texture of the paddle shifter on my fingertips, the g-force in my gut and the turbo whine in my ears from pushing that 7500rpm redline in 3rd gear, going 90mph.

So long Smurf and thanks for all the good times. 

P.S: For those of you may ask why I had to let go of the car, it's simply because my lease run out and I even extended it a few months afterwards. I have a just as fast, more comfortable, more efficient, cheaper to run yet plain and kinda soulless [daily driver](https://i.imgur.com/729RHZf.jpg) now so I'm looking for something that's more of a dedicated weekend car with 2 seats only.

cars,jam,Help reduce traffic jams on freeway merges with your sign design!,"I live in Austin, Texas, and the freeways are always traffic jammed in the morning and evenings because people cannot merge on/off the freeway.  

It's been shown that [zipper merge](http://trafficwaves.org/seatraf.html) is the best method for freeway merging to avoid creating traffic jams.  People just need to be better informed on how to merge by a trusted source, and eventually most will subconsciously adopt the method. 

I hope to petition the local Department of Transportation to test out a good sign that can be placed at the middle of several on-ramps (possibly I-35 or 183 in Austin).  If the petition is successful, I'm hoping the test phase will show positive results to gain more widespread adoption.

cars,jam,How is legroom measured and why does it seem meaningless?,"So the wife has a 2021 CX-5, the specs say it has good rear legroom (39.6). In practice it's super cramped and my 6'2"" frame can't comfortably fit in a front seat if there is a rear facing child seat behind it. Even a compact one leaves me with my knees jammed into the dash as a passenger or bolt upright practically hugging the wheel as the driver... This past weekend we rented a Toyota Highlander for a trip which supposedly has an inch less rear legroom.  It was wayyy bigger in back and I had legroom to spare in the front regardless of where the rear facing child seat was... 

Unrelated but the third row seating in the highlander is a joke. I got back there for a few miles and it felt like when I was a kid in the early 90s riding behind the seat in a single cab truck. Any kid small enough to fit back there properly needs to still be in a child seat or booster... which wouldn't fit back there and it would be near impossible to buckle them up.",178,105,2024-05-08 20:32:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1cn6qtd/how_is_legroom_measured_and_why_does_it_seem/

cars,jam,The straw man‚Äôs last straw: strong-arming himself into a new A4,"Howdy duty dingbats and dung beetles, thank your lucky stars you weren‚Äôt caught in the crossfire I was dealing with a few years ago.

In the auto sales world, there‚Äôs a few major no-no‚Äôs that they teach you from day 1 so you can stay compliant with rules, regulations, situations, allegations and sexual orientations. At the top of that list (right above sell cars) is make sure the dude buying the car is actually the dude buying the car. Something about avoiding fra-ud (I hope I‚Äôm spelling that right).

Dig up your hourglasses and give em a twist back to 2018 when I was a newbie F&I manager learning how to scan papers right side up, and Audi was saying goodbye to the manual transmission and hello to the magic of automagic across the board. R/cars users everywhere were livid.

It was around the magical time of year where we did the annual clear out of the used and abused demo inventory. The detailing department was overrun with sales people desperately trying to remove weird odours and funky stains from the leather in their back seats. Detailers fiendishly scraped rust off of keys before management saw the state we kept our fleet in. 

The lineup was polished to a high gloss sheen of swirls and sadness as we awaited the onslaught of clients who‚Äôd been waiting for the best deal of the year.

And they sure didn‚Äôt disappoint.

Enter Bucky.

Bucky was a corporate accountant who‚Äôd trekked in from butt fuck nowhere and he had his eye on the ugliest of the ugly matador red A4 demos. The colour was aptly named after the smears of blood left on the cobblestone streets of Pamplona during the annual running of the bulls. It was the perfect amount of flash to liven up the dreariness of staring at Fortune 500 financials full time.

He‚Äôd taken it for a great rip with our resident schizophrenic sales rep and once the voices guided them back to the dealership, he was ready to hash out a deal.

That‚Äôs when we arrived at the matter of his trade in. Bucky had brought his rickety 2011 3 series on its last legs so he could throw whatever balance of value it had at the gruesome A4. He‚Äôd done his research and knew his car was worth at least 12k schmeckles with its mileage and condition.

As it turned out, Bucky was smack dab on the money. Him and schizo slapped hands, and Bucky made his way over to see me so I could sort out financing on his new heap. Management had given him the promo rate of 0.9% for 6 years and figured the next steps were just a formality.

Boy were they in for a treat.

It turned out Bucky‚Äôs bureau had more crap jammed in it than a Mexican sewage system after cinco de mayo. He‚Äôd declared bankruptcy more often than Israel declared war on Palestine. It wasn‚Äôt looking so good for our deal.

But the show must go on, and we needed to move this demo. Bucky volunteered to give us his life savings of $600 as a down payment to try and make this happen. Fuck it dude, let‚Äôs give it a shot. I sent him on his way and it was time to get to work.

We were operating under the assumption that Bucky owned his junker free and clear. Talk about a hard fucking no.

Somehow, he still managed to owe 33k on his now 7 year old BMW with a funny ticking sound and more scratches than paint. How how how?

Looks like my captive lender was out of the picture - no promo rates for you Bucky, let‚Äôs fire this off to the banks.

Thankfully, this was around the time where anyone with a pulse and a trade in could get approved for financing, and one of our more lenient lenders came back with an approval subject to payout of his Kia.

What Kia? He has a BMW!!

Looks like our straw man Bucky was way more clever than he seemed. Since he‚Äôd been in a bankruptcy a few years prior, he‚Äôd had a close friend pull one of the nastiest of the nasties and financed the BMW on his behalf. The bank couldn‚Äôt see it because it didn‚Äôt exist, and my dumb ass didn‚Äôt put two and two together when I saw the open auto loan on his bureau for a completely different amount. 

He‚Äôd been registered as the owner of the car and had been making the payments, but his friend was the one listed on the loan. Fuck me this is bad. Or is it?

By some stroke of luck, it was the same lender that he‚Äôd been using to make payments on the BMW. I think the analyst I was speaking to must have had an aneurysm since he actually wanted to play ball with this.

I pleaded Bucky‚Äôs case and they decided to play 1 blind mouse with an approval based on his BMW trade in. We‚Äôd be righting the wrong from several years prior, and the lender must have realized how badly they‚Äôd screwed up back in the day.

Bucky claimed the Kia was his wife‚Äôs car, and the bank was somehow ok with letting him keep the 55k loan open and taking on another 80k with this A4.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that part. Once we factored in the negative equity and everything else Bucky wanted to buy, our $45k loaded A4 netted out to a clean $80k. No wonder our financial system is so fucked.

Bucky had gone radio silent on us through this whole battle. He must have known something was horribly wrong. Maybe he thought he‚Äôd get arrested for being a straw man?

I‚Äôd tried reaching out to him by phone, email, carrier pigeon and turtle dove but nothing seemed to work. It looked like we‚Äôd be sitting on this matador through the dead of winter.

Then out of nowhere all we could here was tick, tick, tick! It was Bucky!

He‚Äôd gotten my message and limped his way in before his Beamer could finally let go and give itself the old yeller treatment. I‚Äôd gotten green lights from the lender for him to keep both his better half‚Äôs Kia and the new car, and he was ready to rock.

We tore through the docs at breakneck speed as if we both could be crushed at any second. He tore off into the sunset with that god awful red thing that someone must have misclicked when ordering.

Some say he‚Äôs out there still running and hoping the matador will keep him one step in front. That, or he‚Äôs been crushed by the man riding a bull and is laying in a pool of his own matador red. 

TL;DR dude buys an A4 while trading in a BMW that his friend financed for him several years prior. Buries a shit load of negative equity despite his shaky credit and the fact that the loan wasn‚Äôt his. Bank laughs and says ok.",298,72,2023-10-19 20:16:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17bkw32/the_straw_mans_last_straw_strongarming_himself/

cars,congestion,"Cadillac re-naming CT6 V-Sport to CT6 V, dubs new V8 engine as 'Blackwing'","Today, during the Cadillac Dealer Business Conference in Las Vegas, Executive Vice President and President of GM Global Product Group and Cadillac Mark Reuss introduced the newest member of the brand‚Äôs V-Series family: the CT6 V.

**‚ÄúAt its introduction at the New York Auto Show last spring, this vehicle was named CT6 V-Sport,‚Äù** said Reuss. ‚ÄúBut when you look at it, when you drive it ‚Ä¶ there is no equivocation.  This is a full-blooded V-Series performer in every way ‚Äî one that‚Äôs worthy of the name.‚Äù

Since its inception in 2004, the V-Series sub-brand has offered customers everything they‚Äôve come to expect from a luxury vehicle as well as a high-performance sedan. ‚ÄúThree generations later, V-Series is recognized and coveted by many as a symbol of Cadillac Performance engineering,‚Äù added Steve Carlisle, president of Cadillac. ‚ÄúIn fact, our V-Series models outperform and often outsell their competitors. As we accelerate Cadillac‚Äôs growth around the world, our V-Series will continue to expand the brand, enhance its image and attract new buyers to our showroom.‚Äù

**Reuss also announced at the conference that the engine for this vehicle will be branded the Blackwing V-8.** Blackwing earns its name from the merlette, the black bird that adorns the original coat-of-arms of explorer Antoine Cadillac, founder of Detroit and a hero of Cadillac‚Äôs founder Henry M. Leland.

Hand-built and hand-signed by passionate technicians, the Blackwing V-8 is specific to Cadillac. The all-new 4.2 liter twin-turbo V-8 engine develops an estimated 550 horsepower and a class-leading 627 lb-ft of torque. The engine is managed by an all-new 10-speed automatic transmission and chassis enhancements that deliver exceptional ride and handling.

The Blackwing V-8 will also appear in the CT6 Platinum model, in a different tuning, and will emphasize quiet refinement. In the Platinum model, the engine will deliver an estimated 500 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque.

‚ÄúThis is the latest example of exclusive innovation that will consistently appear throughout the Cadillac product portfolio,‚Äù Reuss continued. ‚ÄúCadillac remains the tip of the GM corporate spear when it comes to rolling out that innovation. Many of these technologies, like Super Cruise and V2X, will move us closer to our stated vision for the future of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. To get us there, Cadillac is going to lead the way.‚Äù

cars,congestion,"I've been getting shitty fuel economy, so I tried driving 55 mph everywhere.","So last year, I bought a Ford Focus ST. Great car, I love it, but the fuel economy kind of sucks. I was coming from a 2016 Malibu, and was aware the extra horsepower and premium fuel requirement would mean I'd be spending more on gas. All in all, I figured the difference between the vehicles would amount to maybe ten bucks a week. A relatively small price to have my (attainable) dream car. After six months of ownership, I can safely say my calculations were off. Waaay off. 

Due to my mostly highway commute, I anticipated getting somewhere in the mid to upper twenty mile per gallon range. Nope. First month, I achieved just over twenty-one. That led me to spend the subsequent month granny shifting and coasting as much as possible. After two weeks of blue-balling my car with this tactic, I calculated my fuel economy improved by a mere three additional miles per gallon. At that point, I was spending roughly $75 more on gas each month than I with my Malibu. I did the math; that is enough to buy approximately seventy-five $1 scratch-off tickets.  

In analyzing my driving habits, I came to the conclusion that it was actually my time on the highway that was killing average mpg. Apparently the Focus ST has a relatively short sixth gear. I typically drive about ninety or so on the highway (unless I'm passing someone), which means my engine is spinning at around 3500-4000 rpm. I don't know much about the EPA, other than the fact that rearranging their letters spells out ""AEP,"" but I imagine their fuel consumption findings are achieved at somewhat lower speeds.

And so it was that I adopted a radical new approach to extending each tank of premium unleaded: I would simply drive fifty-five miles per hour. I would achieve that velocity only as quickly as was necessary. But once there, I would keep my speed constant, no matter how many people I pissed off. 

I lasted just one day. Here's how it went.

The first part of my commute is a state highway, which I live directly beside. Conveniently enough, its speed limit is fifty-five. At that rate, I was doing about five to ten miles per hour under what most of my fellow rush hour commuters wanted to travel. Occasionally, I caught a glimpse of an exasperated driver in my rearview mirror, but my self-imposed speed was generally met with acceptance. 

An interstate highway makes up the next - and largest - bit of my commute. For most of the way, it is sixty-five miles per hour. Obviously, nearly everyone travels much faster. Usually around eighty. Never is this more apparent than when one sits in the center lane while going ten under the limit, as I did. Most of the cars on that stretch of highway belong to state workers. During the high volume drive times is when they are at their most aggressive. Even more so than during holiday sales, karaoke tournaments, or when standing in the express line at Shop-Rite and the person in front of them is two items over the limit. Needless to say, instances of extended middle fingers zooming past me in late-model crossovers were a common sight. Still, I persisted.

Just before arriving to work, I drive along a wide avenue within the city limits. It has a thirty mile per hour limit and consists of two lanes of travel in either direction, with the occasional right or left turning lanes, used for negotiating intersections or entrances to shopping plazas. Rush hour traffic being what it is, people on this stretch typically move at or slightly below the speed limit. As the turning lanes are generally less congested, I decided they were my best chance of reaching fifty-five miles per hour. Not going to lie, this pissed off a lot of folks. Especially those coming in the opposite direction. You see, there were times when the only open passing lane was on the opposite side of the avenue. As a result, I was left with no choice but to cross the median and hold faith that my aftermarket high beams and their four thousand lumens would give oncoming traffic ample warning to remove themselves from my path. I definitely got the stink eye from more than a few motorists, but I expected as much when I set out on this journey. At least I didn't have to mount a sidewalk in order to maintain speed. 

After work, I like to unwind with one or two pitchers of beer before heading home. More often than not, the aforementioned bar stop provides me with the strength I need to go home and listen to my wife complain about her day. Her typical grievances run the gamut from holiday sales to karaoke tournaments to standing in the express line at Shop-Rite and the person in front of them is two items over the limit. On the day of my experiment, however, I needed that strength to face the other woman in my life: my grandmother. It is important that I maintain a positive relationship with the old girl. Apparently, my mother died while my grandmother was giving birth to her, which left me as her last living relative. That alone should have cemented my inheritance into cement. Still, if I don't put in regular appearances at the swanky golf cart community she now calls home, she'll start talking about how all her money and jewels will go to the Committee to Re-elect Walter Mondale after she passes. I don't have the heart to tell her that Mondale isn't on the ticket this year. In fact, he was never elected in the first place. Also, he's dead.


To get to get to the golf cart community where my grandmother resides, I not only have to contend with the wide avenue mentioned in the previous section, but a school zone as well. The speed limit there is fifteen, and people generally observe it quite closely for some reason. As such, I was forced to mount a sidewalk near the school so as to maintain a steady fifty-five miles per hour. Fortunately, at the time I was passing through, the bulk of the student body had already left the school grounds. Only a few remained, most likely those having just completed detention or chess club. Despite being a pudgy, flat-footed lot - seemingly more interested in their phones than with pedestrian safety - they proved quite adept at diving for the cover as I sped down the sidewalk towards them. Perhaps there is hope for millennials after all?

After arriving at the golf cart community was where the most challenging part of my experiment took place. The only way to navigate it was by using various paved cart paths which snaked from building to building. These paths were rather narrow, as if designed so that only small, golf cart sized vehicles could fit. Making matters worse, the paths had numerous sudden and sharp turns semenly better suited for speeds much lower than my fifty-five. Because of this, I ended up taking a turn a little too wide. That was right about where my experiment concluded. It turns out, the Pirelli P Zero Nero all-season tires on my Focus ST are not suitable for driving on landscaped surfaces. As a result, I was unable to avoid missing that pool. On a side note, Ford did *not* make the Focus ST seaworthy. Also, the so-called ""no-fault"" insurance in my state apparently doesn't apply to criminal trespassing and reckless endangerment. That point would prove to be moot, however, as I am currently uninsured (can't afford it with the fuel economy I'm getting lol).

At the end of the day, I have mixed feelings about the whole thing. When I set out on my quest to maximize fuel economy, I knew it would ruffle a few feathers. I also ended up broke, sopping wet, and arrested. But that's always been the case with pioneers. I never heard Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or Steve Shubin complain, and neither will I. But even though I no longer have a drivers license and my Focus ST had ""flood damage"" reported to Carfax, I can say it felt really good to saving the environment, with the added bonus of taking a bite out of Big Oil in the process.

At the front of it, there was a car on the side of the road, but nothing else to explain the congestion.   Almost an hour later, traveling back in the other direction, I saw the freeway congestion was still there.  It made me wonder.  Normally, if a collision on a freeway causes a backup and then the colliding cars are removed, roughly how long does it take for the congestion to dissipate?

cars,congestion,Rental review: 2021 Tesla Model 3 Performance. Wow I get the hype now.,"This past weekend I took a trip to Florida to both visit family near Palm Beach and spend some time in Miami. I decided to make things more interesting by renting a Tesla on Turo instead of just renting an Altima or whatever from the airport. I had never driven an electric car before, let alone a Tesla, and had some preconceived notions about Teslas in general. I had plenty of opinions, many of which negative, mostly formed by reading reviews, watching Youtube Videos, and general discourse on /r/cars. I wouldn't say I was a Tesla *hater* but as someone who generally prefers a more analog driving experience this seemed like the antithesis of what I generally want in a car. However I definitely was curious and I knew it would be a unique experience unlike anything I've had before in my long time as a car enthusiast. 

I found my 2021 Model 3 Performance on Turo amongst a sea of base model 5 year old Model S's and booked it. This was also my first time using Turo and fortunately everything went well there but this review is about the car so I won't go into it further.

First impressions: 

Holy shit this thing is a spaceship. This is something straight out of a sci-fi movie. The minimalist interior has garnered many criticisms from a practicality standpoint, but it definitely has the visual impact they were going for. 

The screen:

Arguably the giant tablet in the most important part of the car, because it's how you interact with literally everything. And I mean literally everything. Physical controls are limited to two stalks, two steering wheel tumbwheels, window switches, door openers, and a hazard button. 

For the most part the UI is excellent but there were definitely some things that were difficult to find and needlessly complex. I wanted to reset the trip odometer so I can keep track of the miles during the rental. Well I couldn't find one. I couldn't find an odometer at all actually although I'm certain one was in there somewhere. Adjusting the mirrors? You have to navigate through the UI, same goes for the steering wheel. Granted, how often do you adjust mirrors, but I feel this was a bit needlessly complex for something so simple.

Having it be the speedometer, signal indicators, lighting indicators, etc.. wasn't actually a problem even though I was expecting it to. It's very much in your field of view and easy to get used to. Not having a cluster did give a sense of increased forward visibility but I feel having a HUD would be a nice touch. 

Another complaint is the lack of Apple Carplay. I understand how the built in navigation is important in regards to how it interacts with the battery. It tells you the projected battery level at the end of your trip, maps out charging locations, etc.. very useful things, but it also doesn't show colored highlighting for traffic congestion, and finding points of interest isn't as good as say, looking for restaurants on Google Maps, looking at pictures, reading reviews, and selecting one for navigation in one go. Same goes for music apps and messaging. 

The screen is gorgeous to look at, has a very good, fluid UI, but is still too limiting. 

Fit and finish:

One of the huge complaints about Teslas is the lack of quality, fit and finish issues, material choices, etc... My particular car didn't have any issues that I could find. Nothing was loose, no squeaks and rattles, and the interior materials didn't come off as particularly cheap to me. The switchgear (the few of it that it has) felt nicely weighted. Everything was soft touch. Leather felt like nice quality, etc... I thought it was perfectly fine for entry-level luxury. 

Autopilot/Full self driving:

This car was ""full FSD equipped"" which meant that the owner spent $10k for this feature. I did use it quite a bit but I feel it's more of a cool gimmick than anything actually useful. When you activate it, it tells you to keep your hands on the wheel, which I did. But then it starts complaining that you're not applying enough force to the wheel, except you don't see that because that warning is a tiny message on the screen, which I'm not seeing because I'm watching the road. Eventually it tells you to go fuck yourself and disables Autopilot for the rest of the trip. Like are you driving the car or am I? My hands are on the wheel. If you want me to start jiggling the wheel back and forth for no reason so you know i""m still there then I might as well just do it myself. It also tends to over-react to things like a car making a u-turn in a parking lot next to the road. Sometimes it'll veer off course and then yell at me like *I'm* the one that did it. It also likes to accelerate through red lights that it can obviously see are red because it's showing a red traffic light on the screen that shows what it's ""seeing"". Radar cruise control is good enough but $10k for full self driving is a waste of money. 

Driving feel:

One of the things I'd heard about Teslas is the high level of NVH and road noise, but I didn't find this to be the case at all. Is it the quietest car out there? No but it's also rolling on P-Zeros and there's no engine noise. I did a lot of traveling on concrete highways and didn't find the noise to be intrusive at all. The ride quality did impress me. Sports sedan firm but things like expansion joints were absorbed well. The car itself feels like it's made out of granite. 

Handling is very good although I didn't push it very hard, maybe 7/10ths on onramps. Steering is quick and direct and has a nice amount of effort. Very little body roll likely do the low center of gravity. It had playfulness that belies it's 4200lbs of mass. 

Brake feel I would describe as weird, almost artificial, but what was actually weird is how little you actually need to use the brakes. Regenerative braking is usually sufficient for most driving situations including stopping at red lights. It almost feels like strong engine braking but all the time. I probably drove for 50 miles before I knew what the brake pedal felt like. 

Acceleration:

The acceleration in this car is fucking batshit insane. I actually drove it pretty normally for a while before giving it the beans, but even in normal driving you the torque is breathtaking. It's so incredibly smooth. Merging onto a highway is like whoooosh. Passing vehicles requires barely more than flexing your big toe, and at the same time it's very easy to drive sanely. It doesn't goad you into being an asshole.

I did on a few occasions (ok more than a few) launched it from a stop. I can't even adequately explain this. 0-60 in 3 seconds if you're not used to it is fucking wild, and the most amazing thing is that how it does it completely drama free. No noise, no wheelspin. 500ft-lbs comes in an instant and your brain is in the back of your skull, you get tunnel vision, and you're giggling like a loon. It's absolutely amazing. We've all seen plenty of Tesla reaction videos on Youtube and I always got the impression that they were overacting for the sake of views. They're not. This is something you can't experience on a video. 

This alone is one of the ways that I now *get* electric cars. I always was dubious of the idea that an electric car could be a ""performance"" car because acceleration numbers aside, the personality an engine gives a car is a big part of what makes an experience, and that silent electric motors are essentially devoid of personality. However, the lack of personality *is* the personality. The feeling of effortlessness of electric is it's signature trait. Whether that's appealing to an enthusiast or not is subjective, but I feel it's valid just the same. 

Another thing occurred to me. You can get this performance with no penalty. It dosen't matter how gingerly you drive a Hellcat, you're still feeding a large V8 and you're only getting 12mpg. In the Tesla's case, you only spend what you use. Drive economically and the fact that it has a fuckton of power in reserve doesn't matter. 

Charging:

Charging is always the concern when it comes to electric cars. Where do I charge, how long will it take, etc... I only needed to charge the car once and I did it at a Tesla Supercharger. Navigation found me a nearby Supercharger, that happened to be in a parking garage for a museum in Miami's design district, so I had to essentially pay for parking in order to charge the car. All of the superchargers were full, except for one where some douche-canoe left his Tesla in the spot with the car not plugged in. I was able to squeeze close enough for the cord to reach and plugged it in. 

For some reason it was charging at a very slow rate and kept starting and restopping. Fortunately another car left another charging station open so I had to back up in this tight parking garage in order to get to it. This one worked much better and I charged from 30% to 80% in about 15 minutes at a total cost of $10 (to be billed to me later by the renter I assume). In that time I played with all of the toys, including making farting noises with the horn, playing a mario-kart clone with the steering wheel and brake pedal. 

I like the whimsical features they included. It asks the question of other luxury car manufacturers, ""why so serious?"". 

In conclusion: 

I completely get why these are so popular. Everything is very thoughtful and well executed. It's very enjoyable to drive and a lot of the things that I thought would be issues weren't. Would I buy one? Yes I think I would, but more likely I would probably lease one because one of the issues I have with Teslas in general is that they're essentially a smartphone on wheels. You're at the whim of the manufacturer, and things like in-app purchases, lack of repairability, etc.. are still something that doesn't sit right with me. Not to mention that electric vehicles are still quite young and improving at a very fast rate, so If I were the type to lease new luxury vehicles every 3 years then this would be no real concern. I'm definitely not a Tesla hater anymore, and if anything I'm an electric vehicle convert in the future. I actually think my next daily driver will be electric, even if not a Tesla.",338,254,2021-12-06 22:16:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rabn27/rental_review_2021_tesla_model_3_performance_wow/

cars,congestion,"Supra vs C7Z-The daily you can track, compared to the track car you can daily."," Long post warning!¬†

Hey everyone, I wanted to make this post because like many of you I just enjoy talking about cars. My wife and I were lucky enough to own two great cars at the same time, and before it is asked, no we do not have kids haha. I know some of you may be considering one of these cars or own one (or both) so I‚Äôd be happy to hear your take!¬†

First, some background:¬†

**The Supra**

Slowly but surely I have turned my wife over to the hobby that is cars. She‚Äôs always been a supporter, but after I purchased a Lexus RCF in August of 20‚Äô she really started to see the appeal. She had an IS250 at this time and had grown to love that car and the RCF. When the IS500 was announced, we figured it was a wrap. That would be her next car. Then, well‚Ä¶you guys can probably guess how that went.¬†

We placed a deposit on one but the sales guy was being shady and almost didn‚Äôt want to take our order, going so far as to basically ignore us when we arrived to build the car and make the deposit. I had borrowed my friend‚Äôs Supra a few months back and just couldn‚Äôt get it out of my head. I had dreamed of the RCF for years but‚Ä¶it was charted territory now. She didn‚Äôt want me to trade the F, so every few days I‚Äôd talk to her about the Supra. ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs too cramped.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo I just don‚Äôt like the looks.‚Äù ‚ÄúI like the Lexus, the Supra is too BMW.‚Äù Then, she finally agreed to just drive one.¬†

My good friend is a sales manager for a Toyota store we went and test drove the yellow Supra they had in the showroom. She was hooked, but the yellow wasn‚Äôt happening and it was a 21‚Äô (some 21s have oil consumption issues). She wanted a 2020 with the unlocked ECU, black, black interior, premium with driver assist package. No shit, a month later my friend‚Äôs dad traded in his Supra with those exact specs, we were able to snag it at trade in price with only 9k miles. She‚Äôs fallen in love with the car ever since. We‚Äôve put about 10000 miles on it, and it hasn‚Äôt skipped a beat.¬†

**The Z06**

A couple months after we got the Supra, I knew I had to find something else. The RCF is an amazing car, truly. It‚Äôs good at everything, but that means it‚Äôs not particularly amazing at anything aside from reliability and Lexus build quality. I had only owned sporty GT cars up to this point, but never something that could be considered a ‚Äútrue sports car.‚Äù It was almost an identity crisis. Here I was, someone who was just now coming to the realization that what I really enjoyed was something much closer to a drivers car so to speak. Thanks to the bonkers car market, I had a down payment in the form of the equity that had sprung up in my RCF.¬†

Y‚Äôall know how it starts. First it was watching the reviews‚Ä¶then checking cargurus‚Ä¶then joining the owners groups and scouring forums. I had decided on a 7MT Z06 in white, at least a 2LZ. I found one of the cheapest in the country was 30 miles from me, and that was in January of this year. I scheduled a test drive to see if it would be worth it to continue my hours of research. I had elevated this car to achievable dream car status ever since I saw it in high school, but there was a chance I wouldn‚Äôt actually like how it drove. Right? They say never meet your childhood heroes, so I approached with cautious optimism. You know when you see a car on the road 100 times, but when you pull up to inspect one you may actually purchase it just has a whole different weight to it? That hit me like a ton of bricks. The moment on the test drive where I was about halfway second gear, I was giddy as a schoolgirl.¬†

I told my wife I didn‚Äôt plan to buy it. Truly I didn‚Äôt. It had been sitting for 30 days, it was the middle of winter, and it had just been marked down 3,000 online. The perfect storm. It just so happened that after 2 hours of negotiations and me leaving the dealership, they accepted my insulting offer. I couldn‚Äôt *not* buy it. Thus I drove home a C7 Z06 in 30 degree weather on summer Michelins.¬†

So how do they stack up?¬†

**The Daily You Can Track**

The Supra is a fantastic daily. We average 23mpg, the safety features and auto start/stop are easy to turn off, and the hatch is very usable. Radar cruise control makes road trips a breeze. It has one of the best (if not the best) torque converted automatic transmissions on the market. In normal mode you‚Äôd think it was as easy going as, say, a V6 Camry. But, the moment you need to jump a few cars the transmission and twin scroll turbo are very responsive. If you don‚Äôt need 4 seats or 4 doors and can handle a stiffer-than-most-cars suspension, you‚Äôll be just fine. Don‚Äôt be like me and miss out on great cars because you‚Äôre convinced you need at least 4 seats.¬†

The steering feel I think is excellent, much sharper than what the RCF provided. I had always heard it described as ‚Äúsharp but numb‚Äù which didn‚Äôt make sense to me until I bought the Z06, but we‚Äôll get there. The F had a lot of heft, even with the optional TVD. It could handle well, but not without a fight since you‚Äôd constantly be wrestling the weight. Driving the Supra after the F was like going for a run with a weighted backpack and finally taking it off, I was shocked at what a difference it made. It feels nimble, it‚Äôs incredibly chuck-able. The car doesn‚Äôt really wince from quick movements left or right. Just throw it into a corner, as long as you aren‚Äôt full throttle you‚Äôll be fine. The wheelbase and width of the car are perfect for congested spots and tight areas, which adds to the capability of it being a very practical daily driver.¬†

The thing about the Supra, it‚Äôs a confidence builder. The transmission is so smooth, the car is balanced well and is pretty predictable with power delivery and steering response. When you push that car to 7/10ths, it‚Äôs almost like it asks you to go a little more. Brake a little less before that next corner. Put down a bit more throttle when you exit, too. It feels fun, not like you might die at any second if you make the wrong input. We‚Äôll circle back to that.¬†

As far as cons, the wind buffeting is bad. The steering wheel bolstering is quite thin which takes a while to get used to, makes the wheel feel cheaply made. That may just be a nitpick for me personally though. The fact that there is no exterior trunk release really sucks, for what you pay it seems ridiculous that there isn‚Äôt one. You could say the very tight cabin is a con, but that largely depends on you as a person. I can‚Äôt knock the car for not being spacious like an Escalade just like I can‚Äôt knock the Escalade for not being nimble. I‚Äôd describe the cabin as ‚Äúno fluff.‚Äù You have access to all important controls, and space for small items. No more, no less. If you need to haul big stuff throw it in the hatch. The hatch is great, by the way. The JBL speakers are‚Ä¶serviceable. Nothing to write home about.¬†

All in all, the car gets nothing but love when we‚Äôre out in the real world. Plenty of nay sayers online, but that is just how it goes. It got way more attention than I was expecting. Kids, adults, old white men, they love it. We seemed to get a lot of positive reactions from Porsche owners too, which I was kinda surprised by. In my experience Porsche guys are either completely unbearable, or they‚Äôre some of the most down to earth genuine enthusiasts you‚Äôll meet. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a lot of crossover.¬†

**The Track Car You Can Daily**

Like I mentioned above, the Z06 was one of my dream cars ever since I laid eyes on it. The first few days of ownership I was kind of in shock. I knew for a fact I was not at the skill level to even drive this car 7/10ths, and it was still so intoxicating. I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at it. It sent me into this weird depressive episode for a few days, which turned out to be normal when I talked to some of my friends with higher end cars. You get the dream car and it‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶well now what?‚Äù followed by stints of imposter syndrome. Eventually I relaxed and could enjoy the car, but I was pretty much learning to drive again. I hadn‚Äôt driven a stick regularly in years, but it only took a few days to get back in the swing of things.¬†

Can you daily the C7Z? Technically yes. It wasn‚Äôt as harsh for me because if it was raining or someone needed to make a quick trip for something simple, we took the Supra. Taking the Z somewhere just felt like an event, it almost seemed like a disservice to the car to just crank it up for 5mins so I could run to Publix. The Supra being the reasonable/practical option was a weird feeling. If this would be your sole form of transportation, understand what you‚Äôre getting into. The car itself is huge. Tons of length. With the wide-body of the GS and Z06, tons of girth. Ain‚Äôt no way around it, it‚Äôs a big bitch. It handles the size well though. Upon getting the car home for the first time, I discovered it was ‚Äúlowered on factory bolts‚Äù because you can actually adjust the stock suspension on these. The loud crunch sound made by my skid plate in response to the slightest dip in my driveway was something I won‚Äôt soon forget. My wife came out and we crammed a bunch of microfiber towels into the driveway dip. I ordered rubber driveway ramps right then and there. Fellas if your wife won‚Äôt lay down microfiber towels every time you leave or come home and spot you for two days while you wait for rubber ramps to arrive, she‚Äôs wack.¬†

As far as actual daily capability, the car drove just fine under 20% throttle. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily scared of the power available at any time, but I definitely respected it and took it very slow to start out. As long as it wasn‚Äôt pouring down raining, gentle inputs would keep you perfectly safe. Whether it was the throttle, the steering, or the brakes, the car encouraged you to make thoughtful inputs. It was a wonderful driving experience, but whatever you asked it to do‚Ä¶it was gonna do, for better or worse. As someone in the one of the corvette groups put it ‚ÄúThe throttle is a full range tool, not an on off switch.‚Äù This seems like an obvious distinction, but at this point the fastest things I had regularly driven were the RCF and Supra. In both of those cars you can mash the pedal down and hang on, you‚Äôd probably be okay as long as it wasn‚Äôt freezing cold or heavy rain. In the C7Z it wasn‚Äôt happening like that, even in ideal conditions. Nothing made me agree with ‚Äúsmooth is fast‚Äù quite like this car. You couldn‚Äôt really do the whole neck-breaking acceleration thing because you‚Äôd just spin. So when I took people for rides it didn‚Äôt feel super fast, but in a matter of moments you‚Äôre going from 30 to 90 in 2nd just by gradually working your way from 20% to 80% throttle. It was so crazy to me.¬†

The cabin is definitely more spacious than the Supra, though not by a whole lot. It doesn‚Äôt feel as claustrophobic, but it‚Äôs definitely still ‚Äúno fluff.‚Äù The hidden compartment behind the infotainment screen is badass. The quality is‚Ä¶decent. It‚Äôs not a Stellantis product, but it ain‚Äôt the plush RCF either. I‚Äôm not knocking it for this, in fact I would say the Supra and Z are about even in this regard, with the edge going to the Supra. These cars are stiff, they creak and moan sometimes because there‚Äôs just lots of plastic, it happens. The Hatch in the Supra is deep and the barrier between the hatch and cabin is tall. What does this mean? It means your items in the hatch stay in the hatch. The corvette has a very shallow but wide hatch, with a short barrier to match. Be careful with your braking, because what is in the hatch may just decide to make way into the cabin. Found that out the hard way. Also the HUD in the Supra is just speed limit and current speed. There were several configurations of the HUD in the vette, including RPM, speed, gear. It was way more comprehensive. Oh and the Z had an external trunk release, imagine that!¬†

The steering is incredibly responsive, and if you adjust the steering to track mode it‚Äôs very heavy. I usually kept the steering in the more casual touring mode because I liked the balance between ease of use and it still felt plenty responsive. I thought the car needed an alignment when I picked it up initially because it reacted to EVERYTHING. Even the slightest slope or uneven dip in the road and the steering wheel would bounce left or right. Turns out there‚Äôs even a part of the owners manual that mentions this exact phenomenon and basically says ‚Äúnah that‚Äôs normal carry on.‚Äù There‚Äôs a lot of rubber meeting the road at any given time with 285s in the front and 335s in the rear. On a road trip, you have 3 options for sound: music, exhaust, or tires. My first 2 hour trip in the Z I thought to myself ‚ÄúNo fucking way will I do this again.‚Äù My grandfather passed suddenly not long after I got the Z, and my wife can‚Äôt drive a stick so I had to take it 8 hours one way. With everything set to touring mode and the exhaust valves closed‚Ä¶it was actually a decent touring car. For some reason didn‚Äôt seem nearly as harsh as my first longer ride. The suspension is pretty harsh in any mode but you get used to it. Because the steering was so good, I was surprised to note how the car isn‚Äôt nearly as nimble or as quick on it‚Äôs feet as the Supra. You can definitely get the feeling you‚Äôd have a blast on a track, but perhaps not as much fun at autox.¬†

If the Supra was a confidence builder, the Z is a reality check. On the street (especially in less than perfect weather or temps) there were times I felt like I was riding a horse with his balls in a vice and any rash move could spell doom. Little bit too much throttle going around that turn? You‚Äôre in the ditch. Tried to adjust the steering wheel a little too quickly at speed? Now you‚Äôre losing the back end. Trying to show off for the passenger? Now you‚Äôre headed into the oncoming lane. I had always thought the ‚Äúslow car fast‚Äù thing was a coping mechanism. It isn‚Äôt. I get it now. I have a new appreciation for it. In my old G35, I could bang through the gears and squeeze out every RPM possible between 1-3. At the top of 1st gear in the Z I‚Äôm going 60. Top of 2nd? 90. You couldn‚Äôt really wring it out around town, that was highway or track only.¬†

Out of all the corvette groups I joined and asked for feedback in, two things were clear and undisputed.¬†

1. Do not turn off the traction control, your life may literally depend on it. There‚Äôs a prolific video of a black C7Z getting absolutely disintegrated because it lost control and went straight into an F150¬†

2. Don‚Äôt give it the beans until the steering wheel is pointed absolutely straight

You see, plenty of cars have a ‚Äútrack‚Äù mode or a ‚Äúsport plus‚Äù mode for dramatic effect but without much drastic change. Track mode in the Z was just that: track mode. It changed the traction settings, throttle settings, steering, suspension, all noticeably. I fiddled with it for about 30 seconds before realizing I am not Mario Andretti and promptly going right back to touring mode. It‚Äôs really not meant for the street or folks who are not very familiar with this car.¬†

One mind blowing thing about the corvette: the targa. If you‚Äôve never had a targa top car, I wish I could tell you it doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype. I‚Äôm not going to lie to you, if you haven‚Äôt had a targa car it‚Äôs amazing. Better than a sunroof, not quite as loud and open as a convertible. Absolutely life changing. Pair that with the low rumble of the LT4 at low RPMs and the screaming noise you get at 4,000RPMs and above it‚Äôs absolute bliss.¬†

As far as cons‚Ä¶probably the lack of CarPlay in the 15 models. The center console lid leather wrinkles easily and can look terrible after not many miles. The intermittent heating issues on some versions (usually autos). The car definitely is subject to heat soak and will pull timing quicker than you may expect. The dash is prone to peeling in the 3LZ models and I‚Äôve seen the alcantara can age poorly. These were non issues for me as the 2LZ checked my boxes. Also the shifter was a little finicky, it would struggle getting into first periodically, but that wasn‚Äôt unheard of on some of my other cars that were manuals. No blind spot monitoring was also a bummer but you just adjust the mirrors super close and get used to it. Also the cracking factory wheels, jeez that was so common. Didn‚Äôt happen to me but GM isn‚Äôt notorious for their excellent customer service and basically told vette owners to shove it when it came to this.¬†

Honestly the corvette was such a challenge, and I had a track day already planned and paid for before it was totaled. A good friend of mine I trusted to work on it took it for a joyride and made his way into a guardrail. I told him he could take it for a spin but that whatever he did, he should NOT turn off traction or go into track mode. Well he decided to do both and managed to total it not even five minutes later. This was someone I had seen whip around multiple NA high HP cars and even through some visits to ‚ÄúMexico.‚Äù I thought surely if anyone would be okay to drive the car without me there, it would be him. We‚Äôre still friends, he made me whole and was very gracious about everything.¬†

Insurance paid me out all of my equity in the RCF and then some, so I made out fine but man it hurt my soul. I had planned to sell it in August/September anyway to keep my money from the used car price run-up, but it felt awful to essentially go out on someone else‚Äôs terms. I went and bought a 2005 civic for $3000 that I now love dearly and I‚Äôm going to sit out until car prices can normalize a bit. But lemme tell you‚Ä¶I‚Äôm getting another C7Z.¬†

All in all, if your sole form of transportation will be one of these cars then I would have to advise you towards the Supra. It‚Äôs so good in so many aspects that I can forgive the small shortcomings. Plus, the B58 responds very well to some pretty affordable mods and can be an absolute monster with less than 10k total invested. As far as the Z though, it‚Äôs an experience even when stock. There‚Äôs no other way to put it. Under that 20% throttle input mentioned above, it drove like anything else. After that however, the car was a bad influence in the best way possible.¬†

If you‚Äôve made it this far through my rambling, I‚Äôm both happy and impressed. I hope to hear from some of you guys in the comments as well, have a great weekend!¬†

cars,congestion,Guess which country had more Mercedes-Benz sold last year than any other brand (and it's not Germany)?,">!Singapore https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/mercedes-benz-is-best-selling-car-in-s-pore-tesla-makes-it-to-top-10-list-in-2022!<

Fun quirk for r/cars. As far as I could research, besides >!Singapore!< in no other country in the world did Mercedes-Benz sell the most volume of cars, over other high volume brands like Toyota, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda etc. There are some other quirky results for sure, like Suzuki leading sales in India, and some more predictable ones like Hyundai leading sales in South Korea.


>!Singapore!< is notorious for having the most expensive car prices in the world, and it's unique tax structure along with affluence and high standard of living are the major factors behind Mercedes taking the #1 spot.

To simplify a bit, in >!Singapore!< the car price structure is:
(Base cost + base x import tax) + COE.


COE is 10y certificate of entitlement that allows you to drive a specific car for 10 years, sticks with the car when transferred. It is an auction process [and currently 105k SGD (80k USD)](https://coe.sgcharts.com/). It's designed to cap the amount of cars on the road to limit congestion on the land scarce island.
The import tax is a progressive tax based on vehicle base cost and [starts at 100% and tops out at 220%](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2022/2/news-releases/introduction-of-new-additional-registration-fee--arf--tier-for-l.html) and then you need to add on 20% excise. Call it 200% on average.


So your run of the mill C200 instead of being 50k, it's ~(50k + 100k + 80k) = 230k. Before dealer markups.


One of the reasons COE is so high right now is due to a big movement of capital from Hong Kong. A lot of wealthy Chinese are now planning their finances around the HK legal system not being independent. At the same time there's been a lot of movement of skilled labor between the cities, particularly in high-paid industries like finance and tech.


So because of this high COE base cost and tax structure, you have to be fairly well off to buy a car. Proportionally its easier to step up to one of Mercs *many* lower level offerings (A series/C series/GLA/GLB/GLC) vs Toyota. Camry vs C200 is 25k vs 50k in US (100% more), but only 37% more in >!Singapore!<, 210k vs 290k. Combine this with a bit of saving face/flex culture and presto, easy choice.",114,55,2023-01-23 16:06:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/10j9ie4/guess_which_country_had_more_mercedesbenz_sold/

cars,congestion,Bad cities to drive in,"So I‚Äôve started watching Top Gear recently (the first time I watched it in bulk was on a bootleg DVD in Russian), and I found out about London‚Äôs congestion charges. I decided to read some more, and here‚Äôs the deal: the busiest part of London‚Äôs center costs ¬£15 (19 bucks) to drive through at any given day, and another 16 bucks if your car‚Äôs old and doesn‚Äôt meet an emissions standard called ‚ÄúEuro 4‚Äù.

cars,congestion,Have you ever taken a hiatus from owning an enthusiast car to drive something more basic instead? What prompted the change? Did you miss it?,"After moving, I find myself having more access to back roads, but less time to go with work and whatnot.  Plus with increased congestion, they're not nearly as empty as they used to be.  When the weather's nice, the roads are jam packed and driving roads are pushed further and further away.  So finding the time and energy to drive on the weekends seems less fun and more of a chore to feel that the car is not sitting there rotting.  So I take spirited trips to the store late at night or up the highway and back to get the oil and whatnot flowing.

Which always makes me eye up a basic small truck or SUV and get rid of the V8 with the manual and rear-drive.  But I can't help but think that if I do this, I'll instantly regret it and feel like I gave a bit piece of myself up.

cars,congestion,What are your thoughts on US Freeway/Interstate Speed Limits?,"As cars are progressively getting better (especially cheaper cars like Kia's, Chevy's, Ford's, etc), traveling at a faster rate of speed is probably safer than in the past in passenger cars of all sorts.However speed limits really haven't increased to keep up with the times of better cars. 

I know before most freeways/interstates were at 55 mph nation wide, but then states were given the opportunity to make their own (from my understanding). I think the standard is 65/70 MPH now with exceptions in other states like Texas having 85 MPH limits and even parts of Michigan now having 75 MPH limits.

I've actually done a lot of research on this topic and there's so many different point of views that I totally understand and agree with. 

In my opinion, I do think speed limits should be increased a little more since typically everyone around me is never going the speed limit on freeways; everyone is usually already going 5-10 MPH normally, sometimes even 15-20 over! It would allow more drivers to travel at acceptable speeds without being ticketed and allowing slightly faster travel times on freeways with less congestion. For example, traveling from Detroit to even parts of Northern Michigan used to be all 70 MPH limits (and now some parts of I-75 is 75 MPH). Most of the time, I-75 is clear and don't see a reason why it wouldn't be okay even going 85 through the farm lands if no one else is really on the road? The 10-15 MPH difference gets you quite far especially when you're on a 4 hour road trip. 

On the contrary, although vehicles are getting safer/more stable at high speeds, drivers are still HUMAN and can't react as fast as we think we can. If speed limits increase, it does have a high risk factor of increasing severe or deadly accidents, which is my thought on why governments won't raise the limits. 

Personally, I'd like to see freeway/interstate speed limits be around 75-85 MPH nationwide depending on the congestion and condition a section of the freeway is in. I'd love if we could get some sort of ""US Autobahn"", but that would probably never work out since people don't know how to properly use the left fast lane.... lol

I felt it was the perfect combination of practicality and performance with a sporty, not overly aggressive look to it. 

When it was announced that it was manual only, my disappointment was palpable as I live in a heavily congested city with stop and go traffic being a way of life. As this car would have been my daily, I would have had a [cannon for a leg](https://i.imgur.com/p3ZocWw.png) and a clutch more burnt out than a single mother.

cars,congestion,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs C7 Grand Sport Road Trip Review,"  

I recently took a trip from Los Angeles up to San Francisco in my Tesla Model 3 AWD. It was my first time road tripping in an electric vehicle and I did a similar trip in my old C7 Corvette Grand Sport so I figured it would be worth sharing my experiences. 

**Routes:** 

My trip in the Model 3 was straight up I-5 from Los Angeles to San Francisco. 

On the C7 I took a more scenic PCH/101 route up to San Francisco and then took the I-5 home. 

Though not exactly an apples to apples comparison on the way up, I think each route played to the car‚Äôs strengths. 

The C7 route was made more for of an enjoyable/scenic driving experience, whereas the Model 3 route was made to be very safe with Tesla supercharger infrastructure in mind. 

**Driving Experience:** 

**C7:** To be honest my road trip experience in the C7 left a little to be desired. On the way up I picked a fairly enjoyable route along the California coast with enough beautiful views to make for a memorable experience, and with enough fun road for the car to stretch its legs. Here‚Äôs what I ran into. 

**-It was a little harsh.** Though my car did have magnetic ride shocks and we traveled primarily in ‚Äútour‚Äù mode the C7 did beat me up after a little while. For reference I‚Äôm a 27 year old so it‚Äôs not like this is some old guy complaining who‚Äôs expecting Cadillac ride quality in his track-focused sports car. This also isn‚Äôt to say that the car is too stiff to be enjoyable on road trips‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just that the sporty setup does wear on you after a few hours. 

**-The car was a little hard to enjoy in the spirited sections of the trip.** This isn‚Äôt to say that the C7 handled bad, wasn‚Äôt fast in delivering power, etc. It‚Äôs just that the C7 Grand Sports‚Äô limits are so high that street legal and street safe speeds don‚Äôt really excite it. So driving some of the spirited sections on this trip was a bit of let down because it felt like I was only using a fraction of the car‚Äôs potential. 

**-The car and the people around you edge you to go over the speedlimit on the highway.**  As noted above the C7 does have really high limits. When you‚Äôre cruising at 80mph the cars is always speaking to you ‚Äúcome-on you can be doing 90‚Ä¶100‚Ä¶you‚Äôre in a Corvette! Live a little! I was built to do at least 180‚Äù Like-wise, on a two lane high way you get Honda Civics and Priuses coming up on you at 90-100mph because they think you‚Äôll get ticketed first if you‚Äôre going over the speedlimit. Of course the second they pass you though they start going safe speeds because there‚Äôs no sports car to blame for being reckless. Needless to say there‚Äôs a lot of pressure to speed in the C7 and it‚Äôs not a good formula for 6 hour road trip! 

**-The C7 felt like it was falling apart a bit.** On my way back the car developed some super funky exhaust drone at around 2.5K RPM that I had never heard in my years of ownership. I played around with the exhaust settings, when stopped took a look to make sure everything was okay and there was no plausible explanation for it.  After the trip was done the drone never really appeared again, but it was a very strange occurrence. Likewise the C7 inherently has some creaks and rattles due to its targa roof. The targa roof is a Corvette thing and the creaks and rattles are to be expected, but they also start to wear on you after several hours. It is kind of a hard feeling to describe but in general‚Ä¶the more I drove the C7 on this trip the more it felt like I was breaking it or wearing it down. 

**-It‚Äôs a bit stressful in the rain.** There were some portions of the trip where it was rainy and a bit damp and a lot of portions that were sunny and beautiful. In the damp portions you do have to give the C7 a lot of respect with the throttle. GM does do a good job torque managing the vehicle, and the car is 10X better to drive in the rain than say an old C5 Corvette. Just knowing that you‚Äôre in a light weight rear wheel drive vehicle with tons of torque and a really twisty road in front of you, makes you more nervous than excited to be driving. 

**Tesla:** I‚Äôve been enjoying daily driving my Tesla and felt like it would make for a good road-trip car. Though my route wasn‚Äôt nearly the handpicked driving experience that my C7 route offered, I actually had a really great time going up and down I-5 in the Tesla. Here are my thoughts: 

**-Autopilot is great for long distances.** I don‚Äôt have the advanced full self-driving auto pilot functionality on my Model 3 but I do have basic, single lane-keeping autopilot and it worked incredibly well. I drove for several hours without really having to intervene for the vehicle. Being able to take your hands off the wheel for a few seconds, adjust your foot position, etc. without fear of the car losing control was just awesome. It also made it very easy to travel at safe speeds. If cars were driving aggressively it just didn‚Äôt matter to me, my car would adjust itself based on whatever they were doing. Likewise traffic jams, though annoying, were completely tolerable because of the car auto starting and stopping itself. In any other vehicles traffic jams would make a trip completely miserable. The only thing that *is* annoying with the basic autopilot is that you do have to dis-engage and re-engage every time you want to change lanes. Right now the full self driving functionality offers that‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs seriously not worth an extra $6,000 at the moment. 

**-Autopilot needs help in windy roads.** Northern California has roads that are twistier than the ones found in Southern California and I felt like autopilot really struggled in these environments. It‚Äôs not so much that it couldn‚Äôt hold a lane or keep the speed properly, but the car would go a little too far to the left edge of the lane making you feel like it might mess up and run into the shoulder at any moment. Likewise the car just always feels a little too slow to react. Things that I would do when driving to keep things safe, the car seems to do a second or two too late. In reality the way the car is driving is probably perfectly safe‚Ä¶but to the driver it feels very close to the edge and that causes some anxiety. So on straight highways, autopilot is great. When things get more technical autopilot *can* work but it can also cause more worry. 

**-Great ride quality.** I don‚Äôt know what Tesla did with the Model 3 suspension but its ride quality is phenomenal. It feels sporty and communicative when you get on it a little bit, but is very comfortable and compliant the rest of the time. The car never beats you up and it absorbs bumps and road imperfections much better than the C7 Corvette‚Äôs suspension does. This made for a very comfy road trip all things considered. 

**-Perfect throttle control.** The car does have a lot of precision with the throttle input thanks to its electric motors and the regen braking. I had no problem comfortably navigating the tight roads and congestion of San Francisco. Not only was the car‚Äôs speed very easy to manage, but it also has an excellent ‚Äúhold‚Äù function where if you press down on the brake a bit at a stop the car will engage a ‚Äúhold‚Äù and it will not inch forward or backward. This was especially helpful for holding position on San Francisco‚Äôs steep hills. Of course on the highway the car surges immediately into open slots thanks to the instantaneous response of the electric motors. The big point to make here is that the C7 can sometimes feel like a bull in a china shop in city driving, and even on the highway it sometimes feels like it would rather be on a track. The C7 is still very dayliable around town and such‚Ä¶but you just get a much broader and more precise power characteristic with an electric motor for each driving situation you can find yourself in. 

**-The car felt solid afterwards.** With all of the Tesla build quality woes I was kind of expecting *something* to go wrong or for some random rattle to develop that would make me regret the trip to no end. However the car was completely solid after the 700-mile or so round trip. If anything my C7 felt a little tired after its road-trip and the Tesla feels like nothing has happened to it at all. 

**-The silence makes for a zen-like experience.** I‚Äôm not going to complain that the C7 makes noise and the Tesla doesn‚Äôt. But what I will say is that the whole trip did feel very peaceful in the Tesla thanks to how quiet it was. It felt very easy to take in the surroundings and just appreciate being in the moment. Likewise it made for better clarity when listening to podcasts and music on the ride. 

**-It was nice being undercover.** When in the C7 it‚Äôs all eyes on you all the time. There were portions of this ride where I was admittedly going faster in the Tesla than I maybe would have been going in the C7 and that‚Äôs simply because the C7 draws a lot of attention to it, while the Tesla is just another sedan. This also made it less of an ordeal when going to eat in the small towns along I-5 (where a C7 would draw a bit of attention) and I had no worries about the car in San Francisco. Ironically‚Ä¶despite how common Teslas are nowadays the car does feel very exciting, unique, and compelling to be in. It‚Äôs not going to draw sports car attention, but it‚Äôs not like you feel like you‚Äôre in some soulless Camry either, the Model 3 just has kind of a delightful, fun personality to it. 

Here are my thoughts on some things inherent to having an electric vehicle on a road-trip. 

**-Range Anxiety:** I didn‚Äôt really have any with the Model 3. There was a supercharger at pretty much every exit on I-5 between LA and San Francisco so where I would have had to stop for gas I *could* stop to charge if I wanted to. This obviously isn‚Äôt the case along every route or anything like that, but it was great along this very common trip for people who live in California. 

One thing that I thought was interesting was that the Tesla navigation system seemed to prioritize travel time over ‚Äúrange safety‚Äù So for instance along my route the nav system would read ‚ÄúCharge at supercharger X for 15 minutes‚Äù and then it would have me arriving at my destination with like a 4% charge left, whereas if I charged for 40 minutes, I would arrive with a much safer 30% left. I guess for a computer algorithm prioritizing travel time like this makes complete sense, but when traveling with an electric vehicle you obviously always want some more margin for error. Fortunately all I did was nav to each of the superchargers I wanted to hit along the route, charged as long as I thought I needed to, and then I punched in my final destination after I hit my last super charger. So this wasn‚Äôt anything that couldn‚Äôt be figured out or defeated easily. 

**Superchargers VS. Gas Stations:** Without being an electric or Tesla fanboy‚Ä¶I think superchargers are way better to stop at than gas stations. 

First off, most superchargers are in ‚Äúnicer‚Äù areas along a given route. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve gotten off of an exit in an ICE car only to find out that I got off on the crappy exit with the creepy town and the ‚Äúgood‚Äù one is up a few more miles. With superchargers you have less of a chance of that. 

I also found that my car charged way faster than I expected it to. On this trip, we stopped to eat when charging, and each time the car was done charging well before we were done eating. In general I was rolling into the superchargers with around 100 miles of range left and it seemed like I could get to a decent range level within 20 minutes if I wanted to move on in a bit more of a hurry. 

On the way back down to Los Angeles we stopped at the Kettleman City supercharger‚Ä¶which is kind of Tesla‚Äôs flagship supercharger. It has 24 stalls (the largest in the world currently) and a nice Tesla only lounge that has a super nice design to it and is complete with barista, super clean bathrooms, wifi, and vending machines. It was so much nicer hanging out in that lounge for a few minutes than the alternative of running into a gas station convenience store. 

I might just have bad luck, but in the Vette I would *always* get people coming up to me asking me for money at a gas station or trying to have me buy them a tank of gas. I‚Äôm usually very gracious in such situations and help those folks out‚Ä¶but it was always kind of annoying seeing them target me primarily because of the Vette. With superchargers all you‚Äôre interacting with is other Tesla owners. 

Now I will say there are some problems with the superchargers. 

For one‚Ä¶there are a lot of Tesla owners who are hipster douchebags who think that having a handlebar moustache, a cup of Americano and a Tesla makes them an artisan. Likewise there are also a lot of folks who have a ‚Äúhoard‚Äù mentality. They‚Äôre the people who did the math and realized that owning a Tesla would save them X amount of dollars over 10 years compared to say their old Prius. So there are some weird overtones at the superchargers due to how extreme some of the owners can be. If I *solely* supercharged my car I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy Tesla ownership because both mentalities annoy the crap out of me. That being said they are‚Ä¶still better than dealing with folks asking for money at the gas station. 

I also find that there are always one or two superchargers that tend to be broken at given locations. On the way out of LA I charged at the SpaceX HQ in Hawthorne, which also houses the Tesla Design center, and they ironically had a stall that was down and was causing a bit of a backup at the supercharger there because of it. So the maintenance can be better‚Ä¶and if you‚Äôre on the last few miles of a charge and the only stall open is broken I can see that being a very frustrating experience while you wait 20+minutes for other folks to finish up. 

**Cost (round trip):** 

**Tesla:** $45

**Corvette:** $200. 

To be honest‚Ä¶ with how cheap it is to get the Tesla to and from San Francisco it‚Äôs almost not even worth buying plane tickets to get to San Francisco from LA. This trip in the Tesla is something that my wife and I are looking forward to doing more frequently because of how cheap and easy it is. 

**Final Thoughts (TLDR):** 

I will forever argue that if you *are* going to take a road trip in a sports car that you‚Äôre not going to find a better one to do it in than a Corvette. There‚Äôs ample luggage space, the cabin is roomy, and the car *is* fun to drive. I was just expecting the trip in the Corvette to very much be a ‚Äúah yes‚Ä¶this is why I own a Corvette‚Äù type of experience and instead I walked away worrying about the car a bit more than I wanted to, got a little bit too fatigued for a car claiming to be a Grand Tourer, and the fun level was about two notches below what I was hoping it would be. 

The Tesla on the other hand felt like a revelation. It was fun, comfortable, and just absolutely delightful to be in. I felt like I had fewer things to worry about and the whole trip was done for less than the cost of a tank of gas in the C7. It honestly felt like I stumbled across some new found freedom where one can travel in a car for long hours and not feel uncomfortable, or overly tired, or beat up. If you‚Äôre someone who likes to road-trip and adventure drives a Tesla might honestly be your best car yet. It heightens all of the things that make a trip fun and enjoyable, while minimizing a lot of the things that could cause discomfort or issue.",28,38,2019-09-29 12:55:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/das2jn/tesla_model_3_awd_vs_c7_grand_sport_road_trip/
cars,congestion,"Almost had a collision, anyone else have this happen to them? What could of happened?","I was driving home on the highway and i pass thru chicago, the highway is extremely busy. We are going 60-65 and since there are alot of cars, i was side by side another car, which i usually never do but everyone was doing it due to the amount of traffic. The guy to the right of me decided to change lanes without a blinker, not that it would of helped) we were literally parallel to eachother. I tried to move over cause he wouldnt stop even as i layed on the horn. The guy to the left of me was moving over to the left too since i was turning into him at this point. I was half in his lane he was half in someone elses lane and the guy who started all this finally decided to use his brain and went back in his lane.

Im assuming he didnt look when trying to change lanes which makes no sense when were doing 65 mph on a congested highway in the city.

What do u think would of happened if he merged into me?",0,35,2020-05-03 06:59:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/gci2sr/almost_had_a_collision_anyone_else_have_this/
cars,congestion,Do you help others when you are driving? When people get in their cars they seem to be more self centered and not care about others.,"I drive a lot of my friends around and they will occasionally comment on my actions and driving.  I don't think I'm your usual driver.  With that said one friend laughed at me because I honked my horn to get somebody one lane over to move as his turn signal light was green and he had a whole long row of cars behind him, 5 o'clock traffic.  I know what it's like to be behind somebody who isn't moving when they should be so I honked real quick and he moved but my friend was really confused.  He was confused why I had honked because the person in front of me was stopped because we had a red.  After explaining he said that I was strange.

Other occasions.  A few days ago a man's gas cap and gas door were open.  Nobody behind me so I stopped in the turn lane, motioned to the guy, yelled your gas cap is open, and closed it.  Why couldn't the person already stopped behind him get out and help the guy real quick.  This also goes with outted taillights.  I will probably tell 2-3 people a week that they have a taillight of some sort out.  I get some pretty weirded out looks when I ask people to roll down their windows.  One older couple just cracked theirs.  I dunno if they thought I was going to murder them from my drivers side seat but a lot of people seem to fear rolling down their window while I'm strapped into my drivers seat.

Sometimes there's debris in the road and people have to swerve to miss it.  I know this has a high chance of causing an accident later.  I've noticed dozens of cars just drive by these really hazardous objects (full on wheel+tire, sewer man hole covers, boxes, metal chairs, shelving, carpet) instead of stopping for a second or two and moving them to the side of the road to try and make everybody safer.

Another time there was a Jag trying to get by these two cars on the highway.  Little Neon was blocking the passing lane so I shoved my way in front of him and then slowed down and hand signaled the Jag to get by.  Got the thumbs up from the Jag and the Neon guy then had a face of I'm going to kill you on but nothing happened.

A dumb move which I'll never do again but two semi's were going 5 under the speed limit blocking a two lane highway for miles with no sign of wanting to pass each other.  I passed on the shoulder after waiting for a long time and there was a huge line of cars behind both semis.  After passing I put on the brakes and slowed down one of the semi's and then hand motioned for everybody to pass in front of me.  Semi almost rear ended me and I got I think 3-4 people thumbs upping me.

Does anybody else pick up hitch hikers?  I do when I see them if I'm not going 1-2 exits down.  Most hitch hikers are really nice people.  Some of them not so smart but still nice people.  Sometimes dirty but still nice.  Most of them will actually give you gas money.  I was amazed the first two times I got gas money from people hitch hiking.  Most of the time you just hear a bad story of their life like one guy that was trying to find his mate that had gone MIA for over 2-3 years.  Guy had no money but was on a mission to find his friend and didn't care what it took to search for him.  Another guy trying to make it to his daughters birth day.

Lastly I carry tow straps with me no matter what car I'm driving.  In my little Jetta TDI I towed a bigger Chevy E-3500 or something(big 15 passenger van) that was broken down ON the highway at night and couldn't get off because it was a construction zone with cement barricades on both sides of the highway.  I dunno if I saved any lives but I got that guy out of the 70mph highway.  Now that I have a truck it's easier and I've been towing people who run out of gas more so lately it seems.

On a real quick final note.  I've had numerous times where I'm helping somebody on the street and a cop or multiple cops just roll by while I'm trying to get a car out of traffic.  I don't know what EXACTLY a cop is supposed to do but you'd think he would try and help out in any way possible.  Get his car behind the one in traffic and put on lights to help us not get hit, maybe help push since that's what I do most, or anything except just driving by and doing nothing.  If anything shouldn't they help to try and get the congestion of traffic flowing again?  I understand for cars broken down on the SIDE of the road but this has happened numerous times where it's blocking traffic and they do nothing.

Is it me or does nobody else help random strangers when it comes to driving out on the street.

**TLDR : I notice a lot of ways and do help people while driving that doesn't really go out of your way to help.  Why doesn't the majority of the population help others on the street?**",38,57,2013-05-02 23:37:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1dkcbk/do_you_help_others_when_you_are_driving_when/
cars,congestion,Hey! I got a new car. 1983 BMW E21 320i 5 speed manual,"Here is my new baby! 1983 BMW E21 320i. 

Album: http://imgur.com/a/OigDv

I'll put this out there now - I'm only seventeen and this is my first manual car. The original owner did not want to sell me (or any kid) this car because us teenagers are fairly irresponsible drivers. However that didn't deter my father from going out and buying it ""for himself"" for only $1200! Yes BMW's are expensive to maintain and repair, but this man, a retired three start army general brought this car and imported it from Germany in 1983 and has owned it since. It has 173,000 miles (same as my sebring) and the car is mechanically sound. The original owner gave us all service records. It is as stock as a BMW from 1983 can be. 

Pros:
- Only $1200
- Manual!
- Actually works
- Loads of fun to drive
- Head turner, most people don't expect a kid to drive a car like this in a pretty congested area
- Hand brake J-turns

Cons:
- No power steering, power brakes, or airbags
- Cracked dash leads to dead bug friends in gauge cluster 
- Hazards lights stuck on (currently a golf tee is jammed in to prevent them from flashing - original owner was a big golfer)
- A/C broken


Most of the problems with this car are common with E21's so I am not worried about any problems at the moment. I've only had it for a few days but I've already gone on some great drives in the back roads of my county (Clifton + Great Falls). I've stalled twice on hill starts going to school out of sheer nervousness but other than that I think I have the hang of manual! 

All questions, comments, and criticism will be accepted. I hope you all will enjoy looking at my car as much as I do!

tl;dr: BMW E21 320i. Mine. New (to me). Enjoy.

PSA: The Chrysler Sebring may be low on power, a bad rental car, and not the prettiest in the bunch, but she is faithful car and has served my older brother and me well over the past few years. Thanks!

cars,congestion,Am i wrong for learning stick on backroads?,"I posted this on offmychest so ill just paste it here but idk maybe i just need to talk to some gearheads if they have had any experiences like this to calm me down a bit.

>So this just happened like 30 minutes ago. recently bought a stick shift car as i've wanted one for a long time and i got a great deal on it only it needed as starter.

>so once me and my dad got it up and running i would drive up and down our road ( semi rural ) to practice but keep it mind it is loud which of course i bought the car like that but anyways off these roads are ""backroads"" where its either acres of farm land or the occasional house so i like to go on these because its a long stretch of road where you rarely see anyone so i can practice shifting through the gears or practice rev matching on downshifts ( i would never go past 60 )

>And at the end is a bend where there are more houses and because there more congestion of homes i would try to keep noise at the minimum keeping it in 4th at 30 mph which is like 1300 rpm followed by another bend.

>So i would take this path for like a week or so and then following this other bend a dude in an ATV follows me up until the point to where i go and turn around ( theres a dirt driveway but with no house just rubble ) and he pulls up besides me and i open the door ( because window regulator is broken ) and i didn't know what he wants so i asked him.

>""you wanna race?"" he says and i jokingly say ""with that? You'll probably beat me"" since my car isn't super powerful and then he whips out his phone and then says it again followed by ""ill beat your fucking ass"" but not in the context of racing. he says ""i've seen you up this fuckin road every god damn day"" and something else i forgot followed by ""you almost hit someone""

>Now being honest the only thing i almost hit was the car trying to drive away from this fucking dude, i never sped past the limit but anyways he then follows up by saying ""lets race, you wait till we get past that hill and we'll race"". I dont think he wanted to race but i just used that to get the fuck out of there.

>Anyways this was the first time i was genuinely scared for my life that he was either going to beat me or shoot me and i don't get why. I hate instigating or all this shit so i was just trying to be calm and asking him like whats the problem. idk i probably missed some more things he said but it was all relating to what i said. Maybe it comes with a car thats loud as fuck and red

>Like i didn't put anyone in danger so idk what the fuck his deal was, but i didnt speed to put anyone in danger or purposely make the car sound fucking loud, i don't like being that douche so i don't get why he was so mad to threaten to fucking beat me, maybe he was paranoid or something but anyways i am no longer going to touch that road with that car and just going to stay on another path i have which doesn't involve backroads texas rednecks. this does have me shook though",10,30,2020-04-10 05:50:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/fy3zu4/am_i_wrong_for_learning_stick_on_backroads/
cars,congestion,The case against RVs and caravans,"This summer, lots of people have started talking about buying RVs and caravans. It disgusts me. I try to come up with reasonable arguments *against* it, and figured I could play them off this sub. See if you agree, or if I suck.

**environmental impact**

- Big boxes of plastic, styrofoam, metal, rubber and all sorts of crap

- Massive production footprint

- Disgusting chemicals during use (toilets, cleaning, moisture damage prevention; engine oils etc.) and waste disposal

- Storage needs create demand for more parking lots, buildings etc.

- Service industry waste

- Pristine nature loss for wild campers, without the set of rules and limited amount of waste tent people carry with them

- Eventually, disposal and recycling challenges

**financial impact**

- This crap is expensive, even if bought used, people I have talked to consider spending 100-150 times the amount a hotel stay for a family of four would cost. Just to acquire the vehicles/trailers!

- Very high maintenance cost given the amount of usage these things usually see

- Storage cost

- Expected value loss once the RV/trailing/glamping/overlanding trend subsides

- For trailers, multiplied wear and tear on your car's gearbox and more, adding higher maintenance cost; value/resale loss

**traffic and societal impact**

- Driving larger/longer/heavier vehicles than normal on narrow, scenic roads = summer congestion

- Looking stupid and uglifying whatever landscape you move in

- RVs are made palatable for millennials with ""#overlanding"", creating even more tipover prone vehicles full of stuff you'll never need - specialized demands for emergency services

- Local service industry loss for overnight stays etc., RV people are less likely to eat out and use the local service industry except for specific RV etc. services

- Heavier vehicles do more damage/wear and tear to roads, bridges etc.",0,19,2021-07-07 19:47:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ofjs0c/the_case_against_rvs_and_caravans/

cars,congestion,How owning a T–µsla changed my life <in a energy/soul crushing daily commute>,"This story was posted by the user xtheory on a certain other sub, but I thought a few of you may find it interesting if your commute is as stressful as this guy.

I guess it's more a praise of AutoPilot rather than Tesla per se, so it's very possible other cars with advanced self-driving (either existing or in future) will have the same benefits.

-----------------

Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla. But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole. I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well. So here goes...

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic. Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US. The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones. On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day. We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices. This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me? What did I do to deserve this?"" We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families. We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative. While not perfect by any means it was light years better than what I'd ever experienced. I've driven all sorts of beaters in my life, but my last was not what one would consider an uncomfortable car to drive. My old 335d dutifully got me from point A to B while trying it's best to smooth the bumps in the road, however it was still a comparably a dumb car despite it's price tag. When that car caught fire and burned to the ground because of a recall issue, I vowed to be brave and try something different. Out of this wanderlust came my Model 3 LR AWD; a technological marvel. I work in tech and can discern what's good and just mediocre. From day one hopping into the frying pan of traffic and enabling the AP, I found a freedom I never knew before. Throughout the long stretch of the 405 in LA it did nearly all the heavy lifting. It kept me safe by ensuring I was the proper distance behind traffic to avoid rear ending someone, which is sometimes a challenge because of a vision depth perception issue I have with my eyes.

I no longer awoke in the morning dreading the day, the drive to and from work. I trusted that this car, quiet, efficient, safe and smart would deliver me to my job and allow me to work to my full potential. By the end of the day I immediately noticed that I had the energy and mental acuity to better tackle my tasks as a father and husband at home. Even though it's been only a couple months of owning a Tesla Model 3 the nights where I told my daughter I was too exhausted to play Shopkins with her, or tell my wife that I didn't have the energy to cook us a good dinner is a thing of the past.

I'm so much happier now, and so are the people around me that I love the most. Yes, there are sometimes little glitches. Sure, sometimes service has lagged when I needed it. But all in all, if I had to slap down the same amount of cash down on a car I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat. I have the deepest amount of gratitude to Tesla for what it's given back to me; my life. I have faith that it will only continue to get better over time with Full Self Driving, OTA updates, and improved service. But what it's given thus far is so much, and means the world. I never expected or thought that something as simplistic as a car could have such a deep impact on my life, but when it comes to my family and my ability to have what I need at the end of the day to give them what they are worth, it means everything.

cars,congestion,Manual vs Automatic AC fuel usage,"Am I right in thinking that automatic AC is worth it just purely from financial reasons?

Manual AC is always 100% or 0%, not variable, so it uses max fuel all the time. Some sources say 1-2l/100km, depending on usage: more in congested short drives in a town, less on a highway.

While automatic is variable. They say as much a 2x more efficient.

Does it sound reasonable to assume that automatic AC would save 0.5l/100km?

If so, I wonder why has EU not mandated auto AC yet :)

&#x200B;

The stricter exhaust laws which have taken Cali. by storm were brought upon themselves by the current car culture down there.

&#x200B;

 Intersection takeovers have proven to be costly for law enforcement, especially when breaking one up includes calling in air units and dozens of squad cars to just to get the crowds to disperse. These takeovers result in congestion in the districts which they take place in, and in general its sketchy for everyone involved, especially the crowds.

It saddens me to think about, but I'm coming to the realization with the high cost of fuel (5.85 a gallon for premium where I am in Canada), the heavily congested roads even on the driving roads and weekends, and the fact that I am finding it difficult to find space for it, it might be time to hang up the spurs and drive something practical and boring for a while.

I know I'll get more money via a private sale but I just don't know if I can deal with the tire kickers, the joy riders, the low ballers with zero intention of actually buying, etc.

cars,congestion,Welded ball joints detected while servicing my mitsubishi express Van. Mechanic quoted me 1000 AUD to fix it (including some other repairs). How dangerous is it to drive around with it?,"UPDATE: fixed/replaced damaged balljoint/control arm and general driving behaviour feels better. Correlation != causation, but now I have all green fluid (coolant) on the floor after my first 'long' drive. Not sure if the mechanic fucked something up or if just one of my pipes started to brickle/got congested :/

Basically title. I'm a backpacker in AU and the van has been great so far. I do however notice some wobbly sensation when there are windy days. But other than that, the engine runs smooth. And it feels good to drive around in this car.


However, as I have completed the 10k kms I decided to bring it in for a minor service. The mechanic reported a bunch of fixes that need to be done. Amongst it was the lower front ball joint, he showed it to me and it indeed looked like someone did a welding job there. He said this needs to be replaced. As it is the reason for the excessive play on this wheel. And with it, I need to replace the wheel bearing and do a wheel alignment. So yeah. It's at least 600 AUD. If I only do that.


That is obviously a lot of money. But if safety is at risk, its worth investing that money. From what it sounds, ball joints are very important. I just wanted an opinion from the community who knows more about cars than I do! 

Balljoints https://imgur.com/a/PJ5ZC7N


EDIT: I talked to a mechanic who has previously worked on this car. And turns out the previous owners, who hit an animal (prob Kangaroo) had to get it fixed quickly and for cheap in order to continue their trip. He said the guys who fixed it did a spot weld to avoid the ball joint from popping out. He also was under the impression that I shouldn't worry and that'd be fairly common to do that on old cars to give it extra stability and avoid it popping out. The weld was done roughly 6 months ago...

I finally found a spare control arm.. but now I'm wondering. once I get it replaced, how likely is it that something else needs replacement due to the springs etc being out of 'sync'.",1,13,2020-09-07 10:21:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/io16ag/welded_ball_joints_detected_while_servicing_my/
cars,congestion,Gearbox issue on N16 Nissan Pulsar,"Driving in heavily congested traffic today, I noticed my manual shifter gained a slight vibration when idling. I didn‚Äôt give it much thought. When I arrived home to park in the garage I shifted into reverse and it did not engage. So I re clutched and re engaged reverse and I was able to park. Once parked and in neutral with the engine off, I was able to physically lift my gear shifter up and down in the cabin and could hear a knocking when the shifter dropped back to its (possibly lower than) resting position. I have tried to contact my mechanic but he is now on holiday until the new year.

My question is does anybody have an idea on whether it could be linkages or a transmission mount or anything?? Maybe somebody here has experience in this matter?

cars,congestion,My battle to destroy traffic,"The kind with cars. 

after reading several articles. 
- http://jalopnik.com/5538728/how-to-beat-traffic-with-math
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_phase_traffic_theory
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_flow

it is my belief that most traffic problems can be alleviated by employing the 'off-pedal' method.  
   
  when a car breaks, it sends a chain reaction of break-lights going backwards. producing a staggering effect on traffic in that one lane. as the wave travels backwards in THAT lane, any cars from OTHER lanes trying to merge will also slow down, sending the wave propagating through THEIR lanes. Causing the wave to expand on the entire road. 

 The off-pedal method just means that even during the congested parts of the day, you give the car in front of you at least 2 car lengths of space. So that when they tap their breaks to slow down a little, you don't tap your breaks (obviously you would if you're in danger of collision). If 2 or more cars behind your car do the same thing, that space in the traffic flow won't be disrupted. 

When people idly tap their break to adjust speed, people behind them (not all the time) slow down too. 

this is why the 76 of Philadelphia to King of Prussia is in CONSTANT traffic. 
tailgating + tapping on your breaks = traffic

also, when the light turns green if everyone just took their foot of the break, not accelerated, but took their foot off the break, i bet you can get at least 3 more cars through a light.

UPDATE: well, it looks like it doesn't really matter what we do, we can't beat traffic because there are always people who'll cut you off because they see an opening",19,35,2011-01-10 06:05:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ez7sy/my_battle_to_destroy_traffic/
cars,congestion,"For those in countries where manuals are common, do you find heavy traffic moves at a more even pace?","This is something I have wondered for a long time.  I drive a stick in the US, where they are very uncommon. When I'm stuck in traffic, I find people have a HUGE tendency to accelerate quickly to close the gap ahead of them, then hit the brakes and come to a complete stop.  Since I don't want to be shifting constantly or holding my foot on the clutch, I often pick a slower speed and try to match it so I never stop moving, like you see semi-truck drivers do a lot.

In a country where a large amount of people drive a manual, do they tend to even out speed like I do, or is it just a symptom of congestion and people being impatient that causes the stop and go and is not at all related to transmission choice?",17,30,2013-04-25 09:22:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1d27nl/for_those_in_countries_where_manuals_are_common/

Hi all, I just recently fixed a control arm on this car and now thinking everything is great, I discovered a huge puddle under the car that was a hulk green. Needless to say, that is the coolant. I tried to spot the leak but its REALLY difficult as the coolant has sprayed all over the engine area and has left white stains, now that the car has cooled down the coolant slowly gets green again.

Nevertheless, I have checked the coolant reservoir and its empty, also a quick inspection of the hose looked like its a bit congested / muddy in there .... I did some dirt road driving/was in the outback (AUS) where its really dusty/sandy... but I never actually did proper off-roading as its only a 2wd. So question: do you think this is a mixture of rust and coolant that makes it turn brownish and creamy?

Futhermore, how can I resolve this issue without spending HEAPS of money, i.e. it would maybe help if I can narrow down the issue before I bring it to a mechanic ? What will the mechanic ultimately do, flush the radiator out several times and then put new coolant in it?

I also googled some leak-sealing products like K-seal, what are your thoughts on that?

cars,congestion,LS Fest in Bowling Green Ky afterparty riot.,"Fast car enthusiasts were attracted to Bowling Green this weekend for events at Beech Bend Raceway. Some of those enthusiasts gathered at places within the city. Saturday night near midnight city police reported approximately 2000 people gathered without permission at and around the Sloan Convention Center parking lot and Wilkinson Trace. People were recklessly driving and doing burn outs in the middle of the public street. People were even continuing to do burn outs in front of officers. Well over ten police cars were parked in the roadway on Wilkinson Trace. One officer requested that a pepper ball gun be brought to scene due to the large and out of control crowd. A citation was written to a man from out of state for reckless driving. The man allegedly did a burn out in front of officers. The man claimed that smoke from another cars set of tires rolled under his car and merely gave the appearance he was doing a burn out. 

Officers eventually cleared the crowd out. A huge line of vehicles was last seen pouring out onto Scottsville Road. Some of those vehicles could be heard doing burn outs and racing down the roadway. Traffic was so long and congested there was no way for police to catch up to them. 

A huge mess was left behind in the Sloan Convention Center parking lot. It was found to be littered with beer cans, bottles, cups, and lots of other trash. Tire marks were almost everywhere along sections of Wilkinson Trace in front of the Sloan Convention Center, and several more in the Convention Center parking lot. 

Once the lot was cleared the groups of cars were attempting to congregate at other places along Scottsville Road. Several sports cars were seen circling the area around the convention center in what appeared to be an attempt to re-congregate. 

Much like you can hear fireworks all across the city for celebrations, Saturday night you could hear powerful engines revving and tires squealing around almost all of Scottsville Road within the city limits. The sweet smell of racing fuel wafted through the air along with the pungent smell of burned rubber.

It was early in the morning so I was calm and tried to explain to him that he ran a stop sign and that I had the right of way and that if I hadn't slammed on the brakes so hard I would have hit him. This guy got even more angry at the fact that I was calm and started threatening me. Not sure what he was trying to do, I've never had this happen before and it was blatantly his fault for running a stop sign.

cars,incident,Even Stock Exhausts Aren't Safe from NYC Noise Camera Tickets,"Article text below, but I suggest going to the website if you can. There's a video of the incident that shows how the 911 was flagged and how the system works in general. [Link here](https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a60583398/nyc-noise-camera-loud-exhaust-case/)

> Even with a stock exhaust, you and your performance car of choice could have the privilege of paying the City of New York $800 for a noise violation. Thanks to a new noise violation pilot program aimed at curbing loud exhausts and excessive honking with smart cameras and microphones, the potential for punitive punishment is on the rise for enthusiasts across all five boroughs.

> Certainly, there is a decibel limit to the pops and crackles that even us enthusiasts can endure, and the tolerance of the general public often falls far below that line. Particularly in the wake of the pandemic, the prevalence of gun-shot-like backfires has turned public perception sour on modified cars, leading local officials in both New York and California to take action on such quality-of-life issues.

> Specifically, New York City approved a pilot program of noise-monitoring cameras in December 2023, arming each borough with at least five of the newly developed cameras.

> The program is young, but it has the potential to be a major pain even for drivers of unmodified cars.

> Operated jointly by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Transportation, the conjoined camera and microphone operate much like speed or red light cameras, snapping pictures of the offender's license plate and issuing a fine to the registered owner. Unlike speed light cameras, however, the locations of the noise-monitoring cameras have not been initially disclosed to the general public.

> Fitted with sensitive microphones, the $35,000 cameras detect and capture everything from loud exhausts and backfires to honking and blasting music. Eighty-five decibels is the threshold for receiving a fine, which starts at $800 for a first offense and rises to $2,500 for repeat offenders. For reference, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention places the average environmental noise level of city traffic inside a car at 85 decibels, indicating that City officials are targeting those who go above and beyond a normative sound level.

> ""We‚Äôre going after those who are potentially using an illegal vehicle, a modified vehicle, some that are really acting loudly,"" NYC Council Majority Leader Keith Powers said in a statement last year. ""Even in the city that doesn‚Äôt sleep, New Yorkers deserve some peace and quiet.""

> Officials like Powers assured everyday drivers that the program isn't about penalizing unmodified vehicles or the occasional honk. In practice, however, that promise hasn't exactly panned out for people like Jerry H (who wished to keep their last name anonymous), who received an $800 noise violation ticket in his bone stock 2010 Porsche 911 Carrera S.

> Traversing across the east end of Manhattan's 36th Street and funneling into the blue-and-yellow tiled Queens-Midtown Tunnel, Jerry was commuting home to the outer reaches of Queens. Making the light-to-light slog that is Manhattan traffic, Jerry accelerated to the penultimate light before hitting the tunnel, focused on getting home. Weeks later, he received a notice in the mail that he had been caught violating the Stop Spreading the Noise Act.

> With a 3.8-liter flat-six, a stock exhaust, and on a relatively slow section of road, Jerry was initially puzzled by the violation. Sure, he admits to hitting 35 mph in a 25 mph zone, but he wasn't speeding excessively or wringing out the rear-mounted engine, either. With $800 on the line and a car that he thought would be exempt from such fines, Jerry built a defense and filed an appeal with the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.

> Armed with an independent decibel test, certified documents proving the 997 was stock, and questions about the calibration of the cameras, Jerry appealed the violation and lost not once but twice. Up against lawyers for the Department of Environmental Protection, he queried them about the once-a-year calibration of the camera, the sonic combination of rear-engine induction and exhaust noise, and even the gearing in his car.

> On the other side of the virtual bar, lawyers for the City mounted a defense with video footage not previously provided to the owner of the 911. The footage, analyzed by Road & Track, shows a 997-generation 911 accelerating up to a light and a series of red dots marking sound waves exceeding 85 decibels. The dots lock onto the car as well as the street, scaffolding, and buildings beside it. According to the documents provided by the DEP, the 997's signature flat-six rose to 90.4 decibels at its loudest.

> In the judge's eyes, that was evidence enough to uphold the violation against Jerry in both appeals, regardless of the stock exhaust fitted to the car. This sets a precedent much like a California case involving a stock Hyundai Elantra N, in that owners can be heavily penalized for simply buying and owning a factory vehicle. No matter the age or factory status of the vehicle, New York City's pilot program can and will get you for being too loud.

> ""It just makes no sense to not have exemptions,"" Jerry said in an interview with Road & Track. ""And it's pretty clear that automakers don't want to get involved with this. They want nothing to do with this.""

> Jerry is not alone in this frustration, either. Prior to the official approval of the pilot program in 2023, the DEP has been running a small noise camera test program since 2021, issuing as many as 218 noise violations for allegedly modified mufflers last year. Additionally, court documents cite another case of a stock car, a 2018 Jaguar F-Type, receiving and being held to the $800 violation fine for making 86 decibels of noise earlier this year. That's one decibel over the limit.

> California's current noise enforcement standards are actually looser than NYC's, with a standard of 95 decibels for cars and 80 for motorcycles built after 1985. Similarly, California's enforcement standards don't charge first-time offenders and even offer payment waivers for those not able to pay the fine or adequately repair their car. No such exemptions or caveats exist in the text of the NYC Council bill. Globally, Berlin, Paris, and the United Kingdom have also trialed such decibel monitoring devices, and other U.S. cities are considering it, too.

> ""The NYC Noise Code has a strict standard of 76 dB(A). DEP enforces if the vehicle creates noise of more than 85 dB(A) at 50 feet,"" a spokesperson for the DEP said in a statement to Road & Track. ""Stock vehicles that emit excessive levels of noise result from actions taken by the driver. That is why the standard of law is no person shall cause or permit the exceedance of the decibel standard.""

> While the precedent set by Jerry's experience is a worrying one for car enthusiasts, motorcyclists, and anyone ready to test the limits of their sound system this summer, it's worth noting that noise pollution is indeed a major problem in New York City, too. Research from 2014 estimated that around 90 percent of New York City residents are exposed to levels of noise exceeding the Environmental Protection Agency's noise limit guidelines. The results of this aren't catastrophic in the short term but can develop into cognitive issues over time.

> Specifically, research shows that prolonged sleep disruption, hearing loss, hypertension, and heart disease are all linked to consistent noise pollution. Additionally, the impacts of noise are specifically detrimental to children, yielding decreased memory, struggling reading skills, and lower test scores when consistently exposed to high levels of noise. With noise monitored by New York City‚Äôs Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as well as 311 noise complaint data, the top sonic offenders in NYC are unsurprisingly traffic, sirens, and construction.

Road&Track seems to be focusing on the fact the 911 was stock. But that doesn't matter. It's a noise law. If the car exceeds 85 dB it's breaking the law regardless of whether the exhaust is stock or not. And it's a very reasonable law. Auto makers are ultimately at fault for stock cars that break noise regulations, but every time a sports car that's not loud gets released every sports car enthusiast complains that it's not loud enough. Well this is the other side of that coin.",709,549,2024-05-08 19:46:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1cn5n7z/even_stock_exhausts_arent_safe_from_nyc_noise/
cars,incident,Had my first road rage incident last night. (reuploaded because something triggered a bot to delete),"I've always been a safe and cautious driver, never had any confrontations with other drivers or anything. Last night on my way to work I was doing 45 in a 45 and noticed I was quickly coming up on the car way ahead of me. I slowed down as to not hit him. He was doing 20 in the 45. He eventually put on his blinker and pulled to the side of the road to let me pass. As I passed and saw him fade away in the rear view, he started gaining on me, FAST, I kept to the speed limit the entire drive. He got inches behind me and turned on his brights. Followed me for about 3 miles before another car cut in front of me going really slow too so I had to press my brakes pretty hard and he nearly rear ended me. The car in front slowed down to make another turn which in turn I slowed down causing the asshat behind me to nearly rear end me for a second time.

He continued to follow me the next 5 minutes or so, reeling back then getting on my ass again over and over. Even when the road changed from 1 lane to 2 lanes he still stayed behind me. He finally did cut in front of me and brake checked me then he finally turned off the road. I had to make that same turn to get to work but I kept going straight as to avoid any more unneeded aggression.

Was I just randomly targeted for fraud or just a random asshole just trying to scare other drivers for no reason?

cars,incident,Never Changed Oil in Car...EVER - They walk among us!,"Several years back (before maintenance minder feature) a female acquaintance of mine mentioned that her Honda Civic engine had to be replaced at about 60,000 miles because she never changed the oil.  Never? I asked.  Nope - never.  She said she kind of knew you were supposed to do ""something"" but just figured her husband was taking care of things.  Fast forward several years and another woman I know just mentioned that her car was diagnosed with irreparable ""engine sludge"" after only 3 years.  After a lot of questioning did she finally admitted that she had never changed the oil!   This I don't get because the maintenance minder reminder must have be on continuously for 2-/12 years!    I have always bought used cars, but these two incidents make me suddenly very, very leery!   Intelligent, responsible, professional people with good jobs not knowing the #1 most basic task of car ownership.

cars,incident,"SSC officially acknowledges that the Tuatara did not hit the claimed speeds of 331mph or 301mph, 9 months after their initial record attempt was disproven.","In a statement posted to their Instagram page ssc\_northamerica, the company said:

""We have seen your questions for months now and understand your frustrations. If it hasn‚Äôt been made clear up to this point, we would like to acknowledge officially that we did not reach the originally claimed speeds of 331 MPH or even 301 MPH in October of 2020. We were truly heartbroken as a company to learn that we did not reach this feat, and we are in an ongoing effort to break the 300 MPH barrier transparently, officially, and undoubtedly.

Context: In October 2020, SSC completed a world record attempt for top speed of a production car with the SSC Tuatara. The attempt took place on a highway in the Nevada desert, the same location at which Koenigsegg had successfully set the world record of 277.9mph with the Agera RS. After the attempt was published online, some skeptics emerged that something was fishy. To the best of my knowledge, the first person to raise the alarm was someone named Jey Cee ([www.instagram.com/jey\_.\_cee/](https://www.instagram.com/jey_._cee/)) who did some very simple math/physics to prove the Tuatara couldn't have hit 331mph and shared his findings on the ""Koenigsegg 4 Life"" Facebook group. This work was then seen by YouTubers Misha Charoudin and Tim Burton (Shmee150) who made videos analyzing the run using the same math and published their conclusions for the world to see (Examples: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3daTG4\_JS\_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3daTG4_JS_4) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPXXGTuQKbk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPXXGTuQKbk) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSNRKBj\_hUE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSNRKBj_hUE)).

cars,incident,It's time to dispel some myths about trucks and towing/hauling that need to die,"There are a number of blindly parroted statements that keep getting posted here over and over via circle jerks that need to stop considering they're patently false and can be disproven by anyone capable of taking 10 seconds to run a google search.

I know that's a high bar to clear for many people, so I went ahead and ran the numbers for you. I chose to use Fords since they're the most common model out there, and have the widest range in available sizes (full size, modern midsize, old compact, new trucklet).

Full size trucks have not grown appreciably in decades. Everyone always parrots that a midsize today is the same size as a full size from 20 years ago. This is flat-out false when accounting for like-configuration.

Truck	|	1997 F-150 4x4	|	2004 F-150 4x4	|	2024 F-150 4x4	|	2024 F-150 4x4
:--	|	:--:	|	:--:	|	:--:	|	:--:
Cab Config	|	Extended/6.5'	|	Extended/6.5'	|	Extended/6.5'	|	Crew/5.5'
Length	|	226.3""	|	227.8""	|	231.7""	|	231.7""
Curb Weight	|	4478lbs	|	5265lbs	|	4895lbs	|	4941lbs
Width	|	79.5""	|	78.9""	|	79.9""	|	79.9""
Height	|	75""	|	75.6""	|	77.2""	|	77.2""
GVWR	|	6200lbs	|	6950lbs	|	6550lbs	|	6550lbs

For starters, truck lengths in the 80's and 90's (even early 2000's) didn't include the rear bumper in the length calculation. Once this length is added in (I added 4"" if they weren't included, which was for the 97 and 04 F-150s and the 08 Ranger), they're nearly the same when accounting for like-configuration (cab size and bed length). The additional length is due to cabs being extended slightly in the mid 00's to add additional legroom for passengers. This is why the rear seats of a modern crew cab truck are arguably the most comfortable rear passenger seats of any vehicle available outside of something like a Maybach or Rolls Royce. Note that I also included a popular modern crew cab in this comparison, noting that it isn't appreciably different than the most common spec of yesteryear, the extended cab/short bed configuration.

Additionally, widths have been the same 79.X"" forever. This is due to anything over 80"" requiring clearance lights and being subject to additional regulations, which manufacturers want to avoid.

As for height, and this one is a surprise to me: I was ready to concede, but the height of newer half tons has grown less than 2"" for a truck in like-configuration (usually meaning 4x4 in this case) over the last 27 years. Hood heights have grown tremendously as cooling requirements have grown for the increase in towing and payload ratings, but overall is relatively unchanged. **EDIT:** Since soooo many people got pissed about this, let me touch on hood heights a bit more. I tried looking for concrete information on hood height comparisons across various generations, but there is nothing out there except anecdotal evidence or ancient forum posts of people holding tape measures up to every type of vehicle imaginable (there was one comparing to a late model Camaro in that thread). After going through 4 pages, the only notable one I was able to find was an OBS 2WD Chevy 2500 having a hood height of 48"". Additionally, I found [this](https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/www.f150forum.com-vbulletin/1300x901/img002_e974b456957079ab27a2c3b0231943630e8dcfb0.jpg) image of a 7th gen F-150 from the 80's. The stock tires would be 235/75R15s with a diameter of 29"", for reference. **Edit 2:** Thanks to /u/RelativeMotion1 for [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1cwjs6h/its_time_to_dispel_some_myths_about_trucks_and/l4wygri/) comment that gives us a data point of 50"" for the hood height of a 2022 F-150 .

Going even further, with another shocker, when accounting for like-configuration, the length of the Ranger hasn't grown appreciably in length either. A 2008 model and a 2023 model in extended cab/6' bed configuration are nearly the same at 209"" long. The newer one is indeed wider and taller, however. Unless you go to a regular cab/6' bed Ranger, an old model Ranger is going to be identical in every way to a Maverick except being slightly longer (209"" vs 199"").

Truck	|	2008 Ranger 4x4	|	2023 Ranger 4x4	|	2008 Ranger 4x4	|	2024 Maverick AWD

GVWR	|	5140lbs	|	6050lbs	|	4780lbs	|	5180lbs

Another common thing that comes up is towing capacities. Vehicles in Europe have much higher tow ratings than equivalent models sold in the US. This is for tongue weight: trailers in the us are set up for 10-15% of the weight of the trailer being tongue weight, vs 5-7% in Europe. This is for [stability, particularly at high speeds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Dgxe584Ss) In most of the US (yes Californians, I know trailers in your state are limited to 55mph, but you're the exception, not the norm), there is no separate speed limit for vehicles towing trailers. If you want to tow your trailer at 80mph across west Texas, you are more than welcome to, assuming the trailer tires are rated for it. That extra tongue weight ensures that the trailer remains stable and doesn't develop sway.

This added tongue weight leads to another common misconception: curb weight vs gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).

Curb weight is what most people think of when they think of weight: how much does the vehicle weigh when sitting static and not running or loaded. GVWR is the maximum weight the vehicle can be loaded to legally while hauling a load (total weight on both of the vehicle axles combined). Maximum payload capacity is the difference between these two values.

One particular thing to note is that tongue weight of a trailer counts as payload on the vehicle and eats into your available payload. For example (completely made up numbers, not any particular vehicle), many people will see that their vehicle is rated to tow 5000lbs and has a payload capacity of 1000lbs or so. What they don't realize is that when you hook up that 5000lb trailer, you immediately lose 500lbs of your available payload capacity to the tongue weight of the trailer. If that 5000lb trailer is a camper, you can now only haul yourself, and maybe 1 other person and a small amount of gear, at best. You have a total of 500lbs of gear you can load in the vehicle rather than a full 1000lbs. No simply ""hooking up a 5000lb trailer, loading up 4 people, 4 bags of gear, a couple coolers, and a dog"" and going camping for a weekend. You'll be well over your vehicle's GVWR.

If you exceed this rating and were to get into an accident, it wouldn't be uncommon for your insurance to proceed to drop you post-incident at best, or outright refuse to cover you due to operator negligence, at worst.

Additionally, the climate and topography of the continental US, particularly the central and western areas, is much harsher than mainland Europe. This is exemplified in the standard that all US vehicles are tested to to determine max tow rating: [SAE J2807.](https://www.motortrend.com/how-to/1502-sae-j2807-tow-tests-the-standard/)

This standard specifies a number of grueling tests to ensure a vehicle is more than capable of hauling its rated load:  

 * 5 launches in forward up a 12% grade for 16' in under 15 minutes  
 * 5 launches in reverse up a 12% grade for 16' in under 15 minutes  
 * 0-30mph in under 12 seconds  
 * 0-60mph in under 30 seconds  
 * 40-60mph in under 18 seconds  
 * The Davis Dam Grade: an 11.4 mile run up a grade in minimum 100F heat with the AC set to max cooling, while maintaining a minimum speed of 40mph. The vehicle must experience no failures, warning lights, error codes, cooling issues, or loss of coolant during this test.  
 * Trailer sway stability tests  
 * 20-0mph in under 80ft braking test, trailer must remain within an 11.5' wide lane

If your vehicle passes all of those tests at a given trailer weight, it is now certified to tow that weight. Every possible engine and axle configuration is tested independently.

Now please, for the love of god, can we stop with asinine comments we've seen such as ""a Ford Maverick is the same size as a full size truck from 20 years ago"", because newsflash, it's not:

cars,incident,"What Did We Learn After Testing a Kia Sorento Over 40,000 Miles? It Wasn't Very Reliable","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxaI2CUBTIY

Another Kia, another bag of issues, it seems. I don't understand how can people recommend Kia with the same mantra of ""it's better than 10 years ago, bro"". And 24 days to repair... Damn!!! Paying lease and not being able to drive for a month. Inb4 lemon comments.

> The first such incident occurred before the odometer cracked 4000 miles, with Buyer's Guide deputy editor Rich Ceppos reporting that the SUV ""**started bucking and coughing** . . . and had trouble maintaining speed"" on a highway trip. Restarting the Sorento remedied the problem. The Kia left no evidence of its struggle‚Äîno warning light glowed from its instrument panel.

> More than 20,000 miles later, the issue returned. A restart once again put the problem to bed. Only this time, the **check-engine** light illuminated the cluster. The culprit turned out to be a failing ignition coil that caused a misfire in cylinder four. Our dealer's service department installed a new ignition coil under warranty.

> During this same visit, the service team tinkered with the transmission, draining and replacing its fluid and installing a logic update in order to fix the increasingly perceptible low-speed clutch shudder and **clunky shifts**. This marked the **second time our Sorento received a transmission logic update** in less than 8000 miles, the previous of which occurred during the 16,000-mile scheduled maintenance.

> Rather than alleviate the gearbox's issues, the **latest service action worsened them**. The Sorento lurched away from stops‚Äîand even stalled on more than one occasion‚Äîand roughly swapped cogs with all the head-bobbing grace of a newbie stick-shift driver. After putting less than 30 miles on the odometer, we turned around and brought the Sorento back to the service department.


> In time, we learned our Sorento was to receive a replacement transmission under warranty, but it would be a refurbished unit. The Sorento was out of commission for 24 days. (Our original transmission was included in a batch that was recalled, but that happened after ours had already been replaced.)

> Although the **replacement gearbox** did finally end the Sorento's transmission-related woes, it did not mark the conclusion of our powertrain problems. **A leaking oil-pan** gasket required replacement‚Äîunder warranty‚Äîat just over 34,000 miles, and toward the end of its stay, the Sorento began showing signs of cooling-system issues. Multiple drivers reported that the SUV briefly warned them the **engine was overheating, with the Sorento even temporarily entering a limp mode** that limited engine output at higher speeds. But before they even had a chance to pull over, the message disappeared, the engine returned to proper operating temperature, and full power was restored.

> We let Kia take a stab at replicating and pinning down the problem. The issue? A failing rod within the integrated thermal-management system prevented a coolant valve from opening, resulting in the engine briefly entering limp mode under hard acceleration. Kia subsequently replaced the integrated thermal-management system, which solved the problem.",478,229,2023-11-07 14:41:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17pqahb/what_did_we_learn_after_testing_a_kia_sorento/

Not to mention I‚Äôve had a cracked windshield since July and they have yet to get the replacement one at service.

cars,incident,Most memorable driving incidents that changed how you drive,"I‚Äôm curious to hear the stories others might share. Name anything that comes to mind when you think about some of the biggest fuck ups (your fault or theirs) that greatly impacted you, I‚Äôll start with two of my own. 

Event #1: I‚Äôm waiting to make a left turn at an intersection, and I proceed to start going when I‚Äôm clear. My truck‚Äôs windshield pillar is thick and there was a pedestrian walking in the crosswalk that I couldn‚Äôt see because of it.

Event #2: It‚Äôs late at night and I‚Äôm leaving my friends house. As I‚Äôm waiting to make a right turn out of the neighborhood, a jogger is coming my way from the right side. Keep in mind it‚Äôs dark. I see my turn to go so I take it, I look to the left, right, and left. As I turn and look to the right again I see a fucking face in my headlights for a split second, I looked behind me as I‚Äôm driving away to confirm there was a human. I had to pull over to process what just happened. Fast forward now I‚Äôm looking left right left right like a maniac before any turn like that.

cars,incident,One month with the Toyota Corrolla -Cross XLE (rental),"My daily was in body shop purgatory for a while so I've had this 2023 Corrolla Cross XLE with 25k miles on it. Just wanted to share my thoughts on it because I didn't even know this car existed until I had one like apparently you can just buy these in the United states of america lol. Never really hear anyone talk about them.


[They look like this](https://edgecast-img.yahoo.net/mysterio/api/E24129FB7DD55DFFF07E25A60E10F5CDC4FF2B8DCA33CDCB6FA285A78D286623/autoblog/resizefill_w1200_h675;quality_85;format_webp;cc_31536000;/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2023/03/30155130/IMG_93753.jpg)



This thing surprised me because I was originally like ""fuck this car"" & walked away going ""I mean that's a pretty good deal for the price I'm surprised these aren't everywhere.""


Price: They MSRP for like 26k-28k but used with low miles go in the low 20s. Which is actually kind of crazy for this market. 


Inside: [Here's a reference.](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2023-toyota-corolla-cross-hybrid-xse-425-64764b54d860d.jpg). its got a pretty comfortable interior. Nothing crazy but decently cozy for me at 6'2"".  The infotainment is solid its got Android/apple carplay. Had 2 annoying incidents with it dropping the connection while I was driving not sure if that's a universal thing but it did piss me off.  Great sized screen, manual AC Buttons with great AC. Some of the buttons/knob are a little awkward but whatever it's fine. Decent room for storage and could comfortably fit like 4 people. It's not loud inside but it's is not luxury silent lol. Not a big deal but it has way too many unimportant things that light up on the dash where I'm like why the fuck are you telling me this. Oh yeah, I almost forgot the stereo kind of sucks ass but I mean it sure plays music at a decent volume.  Overall though pretty nice for the price.


Parking: Just wanted to mention this because I feel like I could back this thing up into the depths of hell. Great backup cam and is pretty nimble.  I just wanted to note though the parking sensor is so fucking obnoxious. If your like within like a foot of the wall it blasts the noise of slamming on your horn.  Like who the fuck thought that was a good idea. Scared the shit out of me.  


Driving: This is the biggest mixed feelings part but hear me out.  This thing has 169hp lol. Our current cars have over 300hp+ this was pretty jarring. What really stuck in my head was putting the pedal to the floor taking a right on to busy street and I was going like 40mph. However, it did do it and that's the thing that ended up being a theme. 


It kind of sucks but it gets the job done every time. Takes some getting used to but once you do you actually feel pretty confident in it. Handles great too for a crossover its decently zippy. One thing that kind of surprised me is it's actually kind of fun on the highway.  Reminds me of how like a 1993 Honda Civic felt way faster than it was. Do you feel super safe in it? Pretty debatable honestly but yeah lol. It's very functional, I don't want to like hype it up because I don't love it but I really don't hate it. 


Other important specs: Was averaging 34mpg according to the dash. Was pretty much completely as advertised on that and I'm not the perfect driver.  It is AWD for those who didn't know which is nice. Can't speak of its capabilities because it's August and I didn't want to go crazy with the rental lol. 


Side note: if you've ever been in a BMW X1 it feels like a homework copy of that with a utilitarian twist.



Overall: If you need an A to B car on a budget confident comfortable car that has space honestly this is a really solid choice when you look at what's available for the same price.  Like honestly if you get one used for like 23k that's a fucking steal.  It's not amazing by any means but you're getting Toyota reliability at a discount price. It doesn't give the best first impression but it grows on you. If you're in that kind of market it's at least worth looking at. 



Hope my rambling was interesting too you had to kill like 15 minutes waiting for something lol.

Which brings me to a very special day that used to take place every summer ‚Äì Audi Sport day.

Picture this: a truck shows up at the dealership and drops off all of the fastest and most badass models our brand has to offer. The hype around this annual occasion is surreal; we have appointments booked for every minute of every day to get a drive in every RS car in the lineup.

This particular year we had an RS7, an S8 plus, the all-new TTRS and RS3, and most importantly, not one, but TWO R8s. They‚Äôd trucked in a gorgeous V10 plus coupe in Ara Blue with some badass black wheels, and a stunning V10 spyder in Misano Red. All the cars were freshly broken in, ready to beaten up and taken to the max on the public roads‚Ä¶

Since I‚Äôd just moved into the F&I office, I only had a small handful of appointments booked on the cars for my existing clientele. We were only slotted to have the cars for two weekdays, and I‚Äôd booked my guys all on the first day.

Let me tell you, that first day was a whirlwind. I showed up at the crack of dawn with a few other colleagues to take the cars out and get them primed for a day of getting pummelled. I had only driven the R8 once prior to this event, and it was a used V10 model with a 6 speed ‚Äì very different than the DSG demon I now had in the sweaty palms of my hands.

If there‚Äôs such a thing as face bending acceleration, that‚Äôs what I felt when I first pressed the throttle. It was love at first tap ‚Äì man and machine coming together in perfect harmony. That, and me screaming at the top of my lungs from pure joy.

I‚Äôd gone out with a few colleagues in all of the different cars. We did a few pulls up and down the nearby highway, and some weaving through the local low-traffic industrial area.

My clients started to show up a few hours later, and one by one, we went out and were just ripping on these cars. Launch control pulls, brain numbing corners, all of the above. Every single drive felt faster and more sickening than the last. By the end of day one, I was spent. My clients were all thrilled, and to this day, they still reminisce about how much fun they had.

Which brings me to day 2. Some of you may have already heard about this in the local news outlets if you happen to be from the same maple syrupy, snow-covered wasteland I call home.

I‚Äôd had my fill of test drives on day 1, but many of my colleagues still had their clientele to go out with. Enter Bobby.

Bobby was a service customer who‚Äôd noticed the hubbub on the parking lot, saw the fancy tent covering the magically mean machines, and decided he wanted to take part. He‚Äôd come across as a qualified potential buyer ‚Äì had his relatively new S4 in for service, looked the part and was clearly a brand enthusiast.

He‚Äôd given his driver‚Äôs license, signed the waiver and decided the Misano red R8 spyder would be his vehicle of choice. Have fun bucko!

Since all of the test-drives had to be accompanied by a brand rep (insurance, liability and all that fun stuff) my lucky colleague, Charles, was privileged enough to go out on this ride.

And what a ride it was.

He‚Äôd been gone for over an hour when one of my sales managers had started to get concerned. They tried calling him, but he‚Äôd declined the call and sent it straight to his voicemail. That‚Äôs weird‚Ä¶

At that point, someone else had returned from their test drive and had noted that they saw a red R8 convertible pulled over at the side of the highway by a motorcycle cop. Hmm, I wonder what the odds are that someone else got pulled over in a brand new red R8 spyder. 1 in a million right?

It was them.

It became clear at that point that thanks to our shenanigans on day 1 and the tent housing all of our sportscars that there was ‚Äúan elevated police presence‚Äù in the neighbourhood. And Mr. Bobby from service was the lucky guy to get snagged.

Charles is a soft-spoken, introverted guy and his gentle protests to Bobby as he brought the spyder up to obscene speeds fell on deaf ears. A screaming V10 can have that effect on some folks. 

They‚Äôd gone out on the highway, Bobby had buried his foot in the loud pedal, and only the flash of red and blue lights in the rearview mirror were enough to get him lift off. TPS claimed to have clocked him going 157 kph, but Charles mentioned seeing numbers significantly higher than that.

You‚Äôd think he‚Äôd get off easy right? Out for a test drive, beautiful sunny day, fancy car ‚Äì all of those should play in his favour, right? 

Not a chance bud.

The cop gave Bobby an absolute earful, screamed that he was going to end up in jail, and that his license was as good as gone. True to his word, they brought a flatbed and loaded the magnificent beast up to go the impound lot, right in front of my colleague‚Äôs eyes. 

All he could do was watch as the flatbed merged onto the highway and pulled away.

Bobby got slapped with the maximum fine, and a license suspension to go along with it. They were picked up by our lot attendant from the side of the highway, and brought back to the store to be greeted by pure confusion and frustration of my management team and the event organizers. Bobby scooted over to service, grabbed his car and split.

To add insult to injury, the car wasn‚Äôt properly registered, so it took months for HQ to get it back. There was some finger pointing back and forth between my store and HQ about who was to cover the impound bill. Should be Bobby, right?

Bobby vanished like a fart in the wind after that ordeal. We tried contacting him for months: sending registered letters, phone calls and mail-order prostitutes to serve the fine, but he was very skilled at his Houdini act. HQ ended up flipping the impound bill to get the R8 back before some brave cop could take it out for another joyride.

Suffice it to say, we haven‚Äôt heard of a follow up to Audi Sport day since that tragic incident. On the plus side, no one was physically hurt during the proceedings of this story, but many egos were bruised.

cars,incident,The problem with one pedal driving - after experience with Teslas and other EV's,"I test drove a lot of EV's after deciding to purchase one last fall. I tried the one pedal driving which sounds nice in theory, but I found it frightening to use for this reason.

One pedal driving lets you decelerate at a max of \~0.2g's using the EV motor's regeneration versus \~1.0g's for mechanical brakes. This is fine for most scenarios, when traffic is predictable and visibility is great.

However, Imagine a scenario where traffic is slowing at a reasonable rate \~0.1g's (you cannot brake at \~0.1g's unless you're feathering the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, because 1-pedal driving) but there's a sudden need for the car to come to a complete stop. A normal braking implementation would require the driver to simply mash the brake pedal to get full stopping power, because they were already on the brakes. For 1-pedal driving, it requires you to shuffle your foot to the brake pedal to get more braking power, taking additional precious time when you're coming to an emergency stop, not to mention how confusing it could be in panic situations.

Most other EV vehicle manufacturers (VW/Hyundai/Benz/BMW) will let you adjust the regen settings so that it's possible to hover on the brakes while coasting to prepare for emergency stopping. But Tesla's on the other hand does not let you adjust the regen. Why you might ask?

  
It turns out Tesla's brake pedal is purely mechanical, as opposed to others using a blended braking system where it seamlessly switches from regen/mechanical braking depending on how the brake pedal is depressed. In order for Tesla to meet EPA range estimates, it forces you to have 1-pedal driving with max regen enabled.

  
If you've ever wondered why Tesla's have such a wide gap between itself and the cars in front during traffic, it's because of this unintuitive and dangerous implementation. I try to avoid following/being followed by Tesla's in traffic because of this reason. 

I believe manufacturers should educate consumers which scenarios are fit for 1-pedal driving, instead of posing as a better alternative, before more consumers learn about its pitfalls the hard way. This is coming from someone that likes/owns an EV; Misleading consumers this way will not help drive EV adoption and will cause distrust of EV's in general.

Edit: A lot of you are stating rear endings are completely avoidable by not following too closely. Let‚Äôs look an a [NHTSA report on rear ending](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/analyses20of20rear-end20crashes20and20near-crashes20dot20hs2081020846.pdf).

On page 24: ‚ÄúThe patterns across near-crash and incident events are are similar and suggest that the vast majority of drivers were not necessarily following too closely at the onset of lead-vehicle braking‚Äù

It seems like the most relevant factor is response time and whether the lead vehicle initiated a sudden stop maneuver.

So please reddit,exercise a bit more critical thinking instead of falsely accusing me of bad driving.

Edit 2: its called covering the brakes. Always be prepared for emergency stops when traffic is slowing down.",0,102,2024-08-07 11:07:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1em3yif/the_problem_with_one_pedal_driving_after/
cars,incident,Road Rage incident and questions,"A story and help from those here:

Yesterday I was at a stop light waiting for it to turn green.  The light turned green and the car in front of me moved forward and in the lane over the car jumped in and cut me off.  I tapped my horn to express my displeasure (yeah just a tap nothing more).  As we moved forward both of us took the exit onto the freeway.  I passed him and moved over to the fast lane and was driving along.  A few moments later he came speeding behind me and cut me off and braked hard.  It was close, I mean REAL close.  If I wasn't paying attention or my brakes were off I think I would have hit him.  

I thought, OK he had his fun I'll change lanes and let him speed off.  Instead for the next 10 minutes he stayed right in front of me.  Changing lanes whenever I did, randomly braking and other typical road rage stuff.  There was a moment when I thought maybe he's done and tried to pass and instead he slammed his brakes hard again (I saw his tires lock, and white smoke came out). Another close call and at this point I'm pissed.  But then I realized my car is way more expensive than his and I have everything to lose.  I slowed down to 60mph and eventually I guess he got bored and he took an exit and left.  A few questions for the collective wisdom of Reddit:

* Did I do something that offended him so much that he was willing to put the two of us and potentially others in harms way?
* What could I have done different?
* Did I do anything wrong?

I was lucky that nothing happened, and that he exited before I did.  I have no idea what would have happened if he wouldn't have let me exit.  

Thoughts on any of this are appreciated.",3,20,2013-08-25 22:23:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1l29w7/road_rage_incident_and_questions/

cars,incident,UK Car MOT Incident (ATS Euromaster),"I'll begin by saying I have a massive place in my heart for American cars, I know they aren't everyone's cup of tea but that's not the point of my post. My car is a Cadillac CTS 3.6.

(MOTs are similar to car 'safeties' in US/Canada, I think)

MOT time, so I took it to ATS (I won't mention the branch, yet) and they failed it on the following items:

* Excessive corrosion on the front brake line leading to fuel filter
* Excessive corrosion on the rear brake line
* Registration bulb is not functioning
* Excessive play in track rod end (driver front)

With advisories on the following

* Front tyre close to legal limit

Now, I took it to the only place that can sort these things and the following actions were taken:

* Observed slight corrosion on brake lines, so cleaned them up, wire brushed and re-sealed all edges
* Replaced registration bulb
* Replaced track rod end

The garage said there were no issues with the brake lines but they cleaned them up anyway. They showed me, the lines looked like new and had no issues all over.

I took it back for the MOT and they re-failed it on

* Excessive corrosion on the front brake line leading to fuel filter
* Excessive corrosion on the rear brake line

They explained the corrosion is so bad the brake lines are at risk of leaking and causing an accident. Not convinced, I took another look myself and they looked fine. I then took my car to another garage and they performed the MOT the result...

* PASS
* No failures
* A single advisory of tyre wear

Nothing else. I explained a little about the history and he said the brake lines look almost new and are in perfect condition. He even put it on the ramp and showed me again, the brake lines were fine. There was nothing else wrong with the car.
Now I'm questioning all the money I spent fixing the other issues in the first place, that ATS claim it failed on.

Anyway, just a warning to those out there - I'm not for one minute saying all branches are the same, but I've spent a week going through all this and spending a small fortune ensuring everything was hunky dory.",3,6,2017-04-01 01:39:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/62nqw4/uk_car_mot_incident_ats_euromaster/
cars,incident,Window Damage After Roadrage Incident,"Hey guys, I've been following this sub for a long time but never posted before. Today on my drive into work, a pedestrian decided it would be ok to cross the street on a red light. I was making a right on red (legal where I live), and sort of cut him off before he stepped out onto the street (crossing illegally). After the turn, I needed to make a subsequent left, which forced me to stop and wait for oncoming traffic to pass.

This guy comes running out of nowhere, spooks me as I'm waiting by kicking my car, and proceeds to punch my passenger window as hard as he could several times. Needless to say, it was early in the morning (not a morning person), and was shocked, so I just took off without proceeding to confrontation. Looking back, this was probably the right choice because who knows what kind of crazy this guy could've been.

My question is regarding the window, and possible damage. I understand these are made of tempered glass and are tough, and the window still goes up and down fine. Is there anything else I should check for damage wise? Would this punching compromise the integrity of the window? There don't seem to be any cracks.",0,5,2016-07-07 23:18:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/4rpwd6/window_damage_after_roadrage_incident/

cars,incident,Bought a 2018 Mustang Yesterday.,"I posted about my incident with an F150 parked in the right lane on the highway last week. A few days later we got the good news that her Sonata was not repairable So we sat down and started looking for cars online. We talked about another boring sedan, a CrossTrek \(close second\) and some other boring small SUVs. I jokingly mentioned she should check out Mustangs and she decided that's what she wanted right then.

We ended up with a 2018 EcoBoost in Kona blue. The only options are the 10 speed auto and 101a package \(8 inch touchscreen, 9 speaker stereo, power seats, reverse sensors, brushed dash trim, aluminum toggle switches and a few other small things\). MSRP was $30,157 and we ended up paying $25,538 out the door. It was $23,800 before taxes/fees. Might have been able to do better if we financed, but it seemed like a good enough price.

This car is actually a lot more fun to drive than I thought it would be. I sold my 2014 Mustang GT 6 speed last year and this 2018 is vastly superior in every way besides going full throttle and the noise it produces.

The difference between the S550 and S197 Mustangs is massive. Structural rigidity is the biggest thing I notice between the two. The 2018 just feels solid. The car itself, interior, when you shut the door, press a button, go around a tight turn. Completely different than my old car.

Interior wise it is much improved over the S197 but it's still no BMW. I honestly think my Scat Pack has a higher quality interior. However it is not a Premium so that could be why. The buttons and knobs all feel solid. The 9 speaker stereo is pretty good. It gets loud but sounds somewhat distorted if you really crank it up. I can cruise at 80 mph with the windows down and still turn it way louder than I need to for music so I'm happy with it. The seats are nice but they seem more cramped than my 2014 did. I might just be used to my Charger though. MUSTANG being embroidered on the seat back is a nice touch. The shifter feels solid. Having to press the button on top of it to move out of park is strange. I'm not a big fan of the gauges. They look boring to me. My favorite thing about Mustangs is how you can put the windows down and there is almost no wind blowing on you. I was going 80 this morning and there was barely a breeze on me. Some of the window down magic is lost without a 5.0 burbling though.

All Mustangs have line lock for 2018. I was pretty surprised to see it when I was scrolling through the center screens options. I haven't tried it out yet because the car only has 82 miles on it. It also has acceleration timers \(0\-30, 0\-60, 0\-100, 1/8th, 1/4th\), braking distance/timers from the same speeds. The boost gauge still feels wrong to look at when I get in the car. But it is fun to watch and hear the turbo spool.

It also has multiple driving modes. Normal, Sport\+\(can be activated with the shifter\), Track, Drag Strip and Snow/Wet. When you activate the modes a neat little icon appears in the gauges center screen. For Sport\+ it's a large S\+, Track is a racing helmet, Drag Strip is a countdown tree and Snow/Wet is a snow flake and drops of water. I like little touches like that. I've only tried out Normal and Track so far. Normal is fine to drive in. It upshifts quickly and the transmission can't be felt. Track mode you feel the shifts. It holds gears and keeps the rpms around 3k when your foot is off the gas. Track mode is more aggressive than Sport mode in my Scat Pack. Throttle response is great in either mode.

Handling is about what I expected. It feels similar to my 2014 but is a lot more confidence inspiring due to the IRS. It's no slouch in corners but it's not going to touch a Miata. It was a nice change of pace taking some tight turns after driving my Charger for the last few months. Going over bumps in corners is a non issue. It stays secure and planted. It rides well enough, pretty similar to my Charger. It's not a track focused car but it's no Camry over bumps either.

The 10 speed is a pretty sweet transmission. I'm glad to see that Ford finally has a good automatic. Shifts are almost unnoticeable in Normal mode and somewhat violent in Track mode. In Normal it does upshift too early for my liking and is hesitant to downshift. The gearing spread is great. Having an 8 and now 10 speed auto is a night and day difference compared to the 4/5/6 speeds autos/manuals I've had. The perfect gear is always available for any speed. I like the ZF\-8 slightly better but that might be because it's hooked to a 392 Hemi and not an EcoBoost 4 cylinder. Ford and GM did a wonderful job with the 10 speed.

The little EcoBoost has been a nice surprise. I've driven turbo Sonatas and Fusions. I figured it would be like them and have a little kick but nothing thrilling. Well I was wrong. It's no V8 but it puts a smile on my face. Honestly it feels stronger than my 2014 5.0 did under 3k rpms when my 5.0 was stock. I remember that car was lacking at low rpms before I modified it. The 2.3T has gobs of torque. Merging onto the highway can be done under 2,500 rpms and the torque comes on strong at 2k. Passing doesn't require a downshift from 10th. From 3k\-5k it really pulls. I haven't had it over 5k yet. I'm not saying it's as fast as a 5.0 because my 2014 would've left it sitting still once they got going but the low/mid range is very impressive for what it is.

It sounds like my friends' 2018 Civic Si but louder. There is a little bark from the exhaust when you're parked and rev it but I can't hear it while moving even with the windows down. There is some turbo whistle which is nice.

Overall it's a fun little car for my wife. I'm very happy with it for what we paid. Personally I would have to get the 5.0 if I got another Mustang but that doesn't take away from the Ecoboost. I just love my V8s.

cars,incident,Brand new Jaguar F-Type has problems 2 days after purchase.,"I thought I'd share this extremely frustrating event with you guys, as of this point I'm not sure what I can even do. 


I got a new Jaguar F-Type as a daily driver about 5 days ago, and on the 3rd day of ownership it started having electrical problems... Things started shutting off one by one. First the AC cut out, then the infotainment system, and finally the safety features. So I was left without blind spot assist, rear traffic assistance, and any other electronic mechanism that is supposed to keep you from crashing and dying. The car started flashing with a bunch of errors and warning lights saying that different things are either broken or not working. At first I thought it was funny because of Jag's reputation for having problems like this, but by the end of the day it stopped being funny. 

If you've ever been in an F-Type, you'll notice that the car has bad rear and side visibility due to the small mirrors and tiny back window. I almost got into an accident the other day because the blind spot assist was working one second and then suddenly turned off. As of now I am not driving the car anymore because with no AC (Its like 90 degrees with high humidity outside), no blind spots assist, and aggressive DC area commuters... It is just a recipe for disaster. 

So I called my local dealers (**Bethesda Jaguar** and **Rosenthal Jaguar**) and explained my situation, long story short, while being extremely rude they explained that they did not want to take my car until 5 days to 2 weeks from now, they would not provide a loaner or rental til then, nor would they even know when they could look at the car because they are super busy. 

I pleaded with them to just take a look at the car and tell me if it was something that was a quick fix (I read online that if you're lucky, its just a battery with low voltages that can be replaced. Easy 10 minute fix.) They wouldn't assist and refused to let me speak to the manager. Every time I asked they said the managers were currently out.... Every manager was apparently out.

So I felt like I had no choice but to call Jaguar Corporate. At first I thought I would get a solution for my problems, they created a ticket for me regarding the problem with the dealerships, and also the car. After being on the phone for 1 hour the lady on the phone informed me that they solved my problem by calling the dealership and scheduling me to take the car in about 5 days. I told them that it wasn't really a solution because that is what the dealership told me originally, and I was stuck with a car that had no AC, no safety features, and other problems.

All I really wanted was for them to provide me with a loaner or at least a rental. Nope. Since my problem was ""solved"" there was no need for a ticket anymore, to my protest Jaguar corporate closed my ticket. I asked if I could speak to a supervisor and was told that **there was a 48 hour wait to speak to a supervisor** (wtf?).

Since I couldn't really drive the F-Type in its current form. I tried to call Jaguar corporate back the next day to inquire about the terrible customer service and they told me that they have no record of me talking to anybody else or any records of a ticket being opened in the first place. I asked to speak to a supervisor, they informed me that I would be getting an e-mail requesting more information so I could speak to a supervisor. I checked today and to everyone's surprise there was no e-mail. 

At this point I have no idea what to do. None of the dealers seem to care, and neither does Jaguar corporate. I'm stuck with a broken brand new car waiting until they will take my car for warranty repairs. At this point, even if corporate offered to pay for a crappy rental and mailed me a $5 hat... I would be happy. I'm easy to please.
 
It just seems like they make no effort to provide customer service and have a policy of making it as hard as possible to speak to anybody with actual decision making powers. I honestly felt like I was speaking to Comcast over the phone and not what is supposedly a ""luxury car manufacturer"". 

This was my first Jaguar and probably my last. Its a shame because before this incident I really liked the brand's design choices, and history. Plus the F-Type is a beautiful car. I had a Lexus that was half the price and not only were the dealers more friendly the corporate customer service did everything in their power to try to help you out if you had any problems. Which is strange because due to Toyota/Lexus's size, a single customer is much less valuable to them compared to Jaguar.


Sorry for the super long post, I tried to make it as small as possible and I still left out a ton of details. If anybody has any suggestions let me know, I was considering maybe even e-mailing the CEO.. But I have no idea what good it would do because the problem seems systemic. It seems like after you pay for the car and leave, they don't care about you anymore. Overall a really unfortunate situation.

Thanks for reading.



tl;dr: Bought my dream car, has major problems 2 days later, Jaguar and Dealers don't give a shit and now I'm stuck wondering when I'll have a working car again. 


**Update**: A senior representative from Jaguar reached out to me today and gave me their contact info. I'm going to take the car to a dealership in Chantilly. They've agreed to cover the cost of a rental car if there is no loaner available. 

Even though I am happy somebody finally called me and addressed my concerns, I don't like how it took bad press on social media to finally happen. I'll keep you guys updated on what happens. 

**Update 2 (7/28/17 6:00pm):** on my phone. Driving to an event, flash flood happened. Bad weather. Pouring rain. Windows fogged up visibility is terrible. I found a place to park and waiting for roadside assistance. Most certainly will miss my event. Have video recorded, will upload later today. This is what I was afraid of happening.

**Update 3 (7/28/17 9:50pm):** Finally got home. Due to the terrible weather here, every single window on the car began to fog up to the point were I could barely see. So I had to pull over at the nearest exit and call roadside assistance. I stood in the rain with my umbrella for about an hour and a half until the tow truck came and look my car to the dealership. I drove home in a rental. What sucks was that I was going to a concert (Slayer and Lamb of God at Pier Six Pavilion) that I missed because of this. At this point I don't even know what to say. I knew something like this would happen.

cars,incident,What to do when someone is chasing you in a car?,"Today my girlfriend and I were driving to visit my parents along a reasonably busy motorway. Along the way a van decided to sit 2 inches off my bumper in the right hand lane. I slowed down trying to join the left lane, to which he suddenly took great offence. I wasn't going obscenely slow or anything but I slowed down from around 110 to 100 (the speed limit) to join the left lane. I didn't use the brakes just downgeared to slow down. He slammed on the horn and aggressively zoomed toward my car as I was doing so. 

Following this he proceeded to chase us, at points trying to ram my vehicle along the motorway. Cutting in front, flashing his lights and indicator, trying to block my car in to a stop. This was all in mediumly heavy traffic. Luckily my car isn't exactly slow (mazda 6mps) and i was able to keep a distance between him and myself. I know I could have outrun him but I didn't want to turn it into a chase and endanger other people. 

I literally tried every trick I could think of, faking an exit with him in front of me and then diving back onto the highway (when again he proceeded to try and ram me and cut me off). I stayed in the left lane trying to keep him in front of me so he couldn't ram the back of my car. At one point he pulled up alongside me and tried to force me across into the wall. My girlfriend ended up calling the police and keeping them on the line with us as we drove. At this point he was screaming at our car literally going nuts punching his dash and steering wheel. 

Luckily for us we were on a highway and I made sure not to exit as I was concerned we would get stuck at a red light where he could smash into us. This continued for at least 20 minutes if not more, and he showed no signs of calming down, becoming increasingly aggravated that I wasn't going to stop or allow him to ram my car. When he saw we were on the phone he took photos of our car and zoomed off down the next exit. 

Obviously my girlfriend is pretty shaken up after this incident. I'd love to know any tricks for dealing with a situation like this in future, and whether you think it's worth following up with the police. We got photos of the car for what it's worth.",338,292,2017-05-10 17:37:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6acci0/what_to_do_when_someone_is_chasing_you_in_a_car/
cars,incident,What I learned shopping for car insurance,"Recently, I had one of my cars totalled - original post here https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/11v3v1x/what_i_learned_after_getting_my_car_totaled - It was scary for me because my dash cam had failed and I'd had bad experiences with my insurance company (progressive) in the past. So, I decided it was time to shop around. When the claim was settled, I was found not at fault which was a relief, but I still wanted to change insurance. While reviewing a quote on USAA, they asked me to fill in details for ""incidents"" on a few dates - only one of which corresponded with the actual accident. I started to do some digging to find out what was going on with my driving record. Here's what I found out. 

1. Progressive had improperly reported information to LexisNexis - the system that all insurers use when quoting you, it's like a credit report for driving. I didn't know this was a thing until this all went down. Not only did progressive list incomplete claims (claims I never finalized or took payment for) in the LexisNexis system, on all three of the claims listed, various details regarding location, fault and other facts were wrong or missing entirely. The specific incident that caused most of the problems happened years ago. I was driving in a line of cars through a work zone, traffic was crawling for miles. When traffic finally began to relax, I accelerated but felt vibrations and heard tire noise - I thought I had a flat. When I pulled over, I realized all four of my tires had run through tar and been ruined. I have no idea how this happened as I was following guided traffic - I have to assume everyone else hit it too, but they all drove off so I couldn't check with them. I also didn't know where exactly it happened and didn't have time (I was leaving the next day for two weeks for work) to go back and investigate exactly where it had happened. I called Progressive thinking it would be a comprehensive situation. After I explained what happened, they said I was at fault, but I'd pay my deductible and they'd cover it. To me, an at fault claim on the insurance just wasn't worth it - so I said forget it. Don't file anything, I'll just buy new tires - and that's what I did. Little did I know - if you call your insurance company about any incident - it's a claim on your record, whether it's completed or paid out or not. 

2. You can call LexisNexis and dispute things on your record. USAA actually advised me to do this. I called them, verified my personal details and went over each of the three incidents listed. They gave me a case number and told me I'd hear back within 30 days. About 40 days later, I got notice in the mail that the investigation was complete. LexisNexis had conducted a review and determined the results to be correct - which was of course, not correct. I then called Progressive and basically told them they needed to fix their erroneous report to LexisNexis or I would take legal action against them. This lead to me opening a dispute on a claim from years ago - the one I mentioned before with the tires. The other two claims they had on the record, though one was another never completed never paid claim, were both listed as not at fault - and as I learned earlier, any incident you mention on the phone to your insurance is a claim on your record - regardless of fault, whether you complete it or whether anyone pays anything. It's still a claim on your record. This was a huge lesson to me and a powerful reminder that insurance companies are not your friend, you cannot trust them, and you need to be extremely careful what you say to an insurance agent. 

3. Progressive called me back within 48 hours. After some phone tag I finally got connected with the handler. Their position was that I hit something so it was my fault. I then reiterated that I was following a line of cars that were guided through uncured tar and I could not know that the road workers were doing their job incorrectly. I could not know by looking at the road surface that the tar was not ready to be driven on. I had to obey the worker's guidance and assume that they were directing motorists to drive in a safe direction. Furthermore, Progressive ONLY knows what I told them about this incident. Because no claim was ever completed, no investigation was ever conducted, no police report was filed and no one was ever cited - my words are literally the only thing Progressive has to go on. I was bounced around a few times before being told if I wanted to dispute the claim, I would have had to do it when it was opened. I said I did not know at the time they were making a fraudulent or erroneous report to LexisNexis, and had I known they were, I would have disputed that at the time. I got quoted more scripted policy nonsense at which point I told her she either needed to fix this or I would take legal action. She then explained she would have to escalate this to another person who would contact me. The next day, I got a call from someone higher up who asked me to clarify exactly what was going on and I explained my whole story over again to him. He was immediately confused - first of all, he couldn't understand why I was even found at fault to begin with. Second, he didn't understand why I'd been transferred to him. He said he would find me an answer and call me back. A few days later he let me know he was able to correct the liability decision on the original claim and advised it would take a few weeks for everything to update. 

After a month, I called LexisNexis to ensure the corrections had been made. Once I confirmed they had been, I called USAA to tell them my driving record had been updated and I would like to know if it impacted my premium at all. It turns out even though USAA could see an at fault claim on my LexisNexis records, their system didn't hold it against me because the claim was listed as incomplete with no payouts having been made. So I guess not all insurance companies compute your rate the same way. This may be obvious to some, but it was hard to understand how something could cost me money with one firm and not with another - especially an at fault claim on the record. In any case, props to USAA for not using faulty or incomplete information to penalize customers.

4. Perhaps the biggest lesson here - I did not realize how badly underinsured I was until I really started shopping around. When I was 22 I was looking for bare bones, cheap insurance. I was a broke college kid trying to get off my parents plan, so I took 25K property damage and 50K personal injury (woefully inadequate) but also took things I honestly didn't need like supplemental health, accidental death and loss of income benefits. I realize those things may be hugely important for some, but given my employment situation and health and life insurance coverage, it really doesn't do much for me. Every time I shopped around for insurance in the past 10 years, I sent other insurers my standing policy and they basically tried to quote me equivalent or lower than that, cause they were trying to win me over on price. Nobody stopped to actually discuss my situation and how underinsured I was - and you know what? That's my fault. I was being negligent. I now have a 100K property / 300K personal injury policy and by eliminating some of the miscellaneous add ons that I had no need for, I was able to get much more appropriate coverage without raising my monthly premium by much. 

TL;DR :: Check your LexisNexis report to make sure insurance company errors aren't costing you money. If there's errors, you can dispute them! Also, check your insurance policy periodically to make sure it actually covers everything you might need.",149,102,2023-06-22 00:18:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/14ffxbb/what_i_learned_shopping_for_car_insurance/
cars,incident,How it feels to drive the slowest vehicle on the road ? A 1982 Mitsubishi truck.,"I saw a post yesterday about someone doubting whether their 04 civic will do in highway. I drive a much slower vehicle. A 1982 3.5  tone Mitsubishi truck. I would say it can be compared in size to a modern 3500 series American truck. The plot twist however is that it is powered by a 4 cylinder NA diesel. I drive it for work. This thing will do 70 KPH (43.5MPh)  in good stretch of road. 

SO one might ask how can someone survive and how does it feel. 

First, forget about highways. I have never touched a highway and probably never will. However, I have been to roads where speed limits were 100KMH (62MPH). Of course I stay at the furthest right lane. surprisingly, People are not angry that I am going under speed limit. I guess they expect that from a similar vehicle. I did however get passed by aggressively by some vehicles in one way roads. I do stop for cars to pass if I am in single way. 

Passing other vehicles, the second thing you need to forget about. During the first or second day of me driving for this job, there was a loaded semi truck to my left. I said no way I am waiting behind that. We were both at a traffic light and I went to the left of the semi ( the faster lane). Fast forward, the green light opens and I accelerate at WOT shifting gears as fast as possible. We were about the same pace and I couldn't return to the slow lane. The semi truck driver saw my struggle and let off gas to allow me to go back to the right lane. Didn't try to pass anyone after that incident. 

Momentum driving, this is the best way to keep up with traffic. For example, when I approach a roundabout, I try to look into it from a distance and enter at the right time so I don't come to a stop before the roundabout. Within a safe limit. 

To conclude, a modern slow car can go through most situations you face in the road. Especially if you are alert to your surroundings. You have to calculate situations before everyone and adjust your driving to that. Frustrating at times yes, but doable. 

I sometimes get the question of how would someone drive 1982 truck for work. Answer is that I drive small trucks in a 3rd world country. I myself wondered how this vehicle is allowed to operate commercially in public roads.",348,123,2021-09-12 22:43:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/pmwrs7/how_it_feels_to_drive_the_slowest_vehicle_on_the/

cars,incident,"When suffering tailgating in a single lane (cannot move over to let the bad driver pass), should you put your hazard lights on and smoothly/slowly decelerate to the speed at which their following distance is appropriate until you are able to to change lanes to let them pass? Know a better strategy?","Edit: The general consensus in answer to the question is ""decelerate slowly, move as far over as you can, and signal if possible for them to pass you"". It is remarkable how much hatred there is from Reddit users who don't read. I'm disabling inbox notifications now due to the hateful vitriol so many are posting.

***

Recently I was in a single-lane no-shoulder country road going the limit 55 mi/hr ~ 90 km/hr and a car began tailgating me at a distance appropriate for 25 mi/hr ~ 40 km/hr.

It was highly concerning, because if an animal ran into the road, or if an oncoming car swerved into my lane, or if I came across another hazard (e.g. an object fallen out of the back of a truck), I would be forced to either hit the object, run off the road, go into the oncoming traffic lane, or slam on brakes and probably get rear-ended. 

It seemed to me the best strategy would have been to turn on hazard lights and decelerate ~ 1 km/hr/s until the speed matched the car's following distance, so the bad driver behind me would be more likely to hit the brakes in time if I had to brake suddenly.

Of course, if the bad driver doesn't understand why I'm slowing, this risks triggering anger and road rage. In the USA this could even result in death, as [in some regions people will literally shoot you in your car on the highway](https://www.ecosia.org/search?&q=shot%20driving%20on%20Alabama%20highway).

Ultimately I decided to 'risk getting rear-ended' and continue driving the speed limit until I exited that single-lane portion of road several minutes later, weighing 'need to suddenly brake' vs 'firearm road range incident' as ""low v. unknown(great?)"".

What do you think of this strategy of hazard lights + slow deceleration to match the car's traveling distance? Should we look for a large magnetic bumper decal saying ""IF TAILGATING WILL SLOW"" to put on our car before such trips? 

In the future if it happens again I think there might be enough road to hazard-light, slow, pull to the side and they'll probably get the idea to swerve and pass me.

Curious to hear what you think of all this, and what the best strategy is.",0,97,2024-01-27 01:36:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1abriqb/when_suffering_tailgating_in_a_single_lane_cannot/
cars,incident,"Tow truck driver left my car in drive on his trailer, and got out.... Images in post.","https://imgur.com/a/IVeXC1r

I ordered a tow truck driver to pickup a Jeep I bought from an auction and he ended up being over a day late on when he promised to deliver it. On delivery, while trying to jump-start it, he mixed his jump box cables with the negative and positive. I already was a bit annoyed by this. 

Then he started to drive it off his ramp, and it got hung up on his trailer because he hadn't adjusted the hydraulic lift to lower. So he got out of it while it was still set in drive. And started adjusting his lift, it got un-hung and immediately started driving down his ramp. He froze and we all watched as the car plummeted down. Trailer got beat up, my doors got dented, tires popped, and underside got some major damage.

I was upset but calm, so I started to take pictures of the incident, as I did that, the tow truck driver got in my face and started yelling. He yelled about why am I taking pictures, there is no damage to my Jeep. I proceeded to take pictures, then he threatened to beat me up..... I then asked what his plan is, he told me to call a flatbed and have them fix it. I argued with him that he should call the flatbed. Then he told me he didn't have insurance and there is nothing he could do.

I called the police, once I did that, he called the flatbed and gave me an insurance phone number and some random policy number. I called his insurance company that day and told them the incident, and asked to clarify if this driver is actually insured. They informed me they can not confirm or deny any of that.

My question is this, what can I do to cover my ass in this situation so I don't get screwed over?

Tow truck driver will most likely deny everything he can, and make up some crazy stories as he went on to say things like he'll steal my car if I call his insurance company. Officer also told me since it's on private property he wouldn't file a report and can't help this dispute.

Link at top is pictures of the incident.

Side info: This vehicle I purchased from IAAI (Insurance Auctions) It has a salvage title, and had rear trunk damage. This car is also not owned by me, and the title hasn't even been re-assigned to the dealership I bought this through. The dealer I bought it through is aware of this, and is willing to work with me. The original title is still in the previous insurance companies name before it went to auction.


**EDIT**
Based on all the amazing feedback and help from the community, I believe my best bet is to insure this vehicle today myself. And then reach out to them explaining what happened. Hopefully this gets resolved through insurance, and the transporters insurance pays if he actually has insurance. And if not, small claims court is the next step.",506,127,2019-09-23 19:21:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d86t37/tow_truck_driver_left_my_car_in_drive_on_his/
